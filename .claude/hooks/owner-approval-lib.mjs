// OWNER APPROVAL (Mason, 2026-09-29: "approved all three"; by chat reply since
// 2026-10-09: "remove the windows hello thing ... I do a lot of work from phone",
// then "go - i accept the trade off" once the trade-off below was put to him).
//
// migration-apply-lib.mjs parks three kinds of migration for Mason: one that
// DELETES data, one that OVERWRITES existing rows, and one that CHANGES WHO CAN
// ACCESS WHAT. This module is how he approves one of them.
//
// Until 2026-10-09 he approved with a Windows Hello signature, which needed him
// at the PC. He works mostly from his phone, so the approval is now his reply in
// the chat:
//   1. scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs builds a REQUEST from the file itself:
//      the exact migration (its name and the sha256 of its LF-normalized SQL), the
//      pull request and its exact head, what the safety check flagged, the Claude
//      Code session it was built in, and a 6-digit code. It is saved beside the
//      checkout's other proofs.
//   2. The agent shows Mason the plain-English summary and the exact reply.
//   3. He replies `approve <code>` from anywhere, in THAT conversation.
//      owner-approval-prompt.mjs, which Claude Code runs as a UserPromptSubmit hook
//      on each message sent into a session, turns the request into an APPROVAL good
//      for 30 minutes only when the reply arrives in the session that built it.
//   4. scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs checks it LAST, after the reviewer proofs,
//      the Sol proof and the landing gate, refuses it in any other session, and
//      uses it up once.
//
// THE TRADE-OFF MASON ACCEPTED. The reply must be the WHOLE message, so a peer
// session's message (always wrapped in an envelope or preamble), a subagent's
// report or a quoted line never matches, and a reply in another conversation
// never counts. That stops a parked migration being applied by mistake, on a
// misread handoff, or on a relayed "Mason said yes". It does not stop an agent
// that deliberately fakes the approval — by writing the approval file, or by
// running the reply hook by hand with a made-up message and session id: agents
// run on Mason's PC with his permissions, and only Windows Hello could rule that
// out (Luna round 2, PR #894, made the second route explicit). The file lives in
// .claude/session-state, which the review proof guard protects like every other proof.
//
// It is NOT a general override. It only lets a parked migration continue to the
// SAME checks every other migration must pass; it only works through
// scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs; and it works once.
