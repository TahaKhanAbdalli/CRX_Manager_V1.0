// Shared decision logic for live migration applies.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-24). Every gate that protects a live migration
// apply used to live inside migration-apply-guard.mjs, the PreToolUse hook that
// watches `mcp__supabase__apply_migration`. That tool transmits the migration as
// a *pasted string*, and the guard binds the reviewer proof to
// sha256(tool_input.query). A migration too large to re-emit byte-exact in one
// tool call therefore could not be applied at all — not because it was unsafe,
// but because the only door with a lock on it was too small to fit through
// (hit by 20260816120000_draw_down_split_order_lines_by_price_tier, 162,022
// bytes / 2,891 lines).
//
// The fix is a second door, NOT a second lock. This module holds the rules; the
// hook and scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs both ask it for a verdict. There is
// deliberately ONE implementation: a copy of these checks living beside the
// file-bytes path would drift, and the looser copy would become the way in.
//
// The rules themselves are unchanged from the hook's straight-line version —
// this is a mechanical transform where `out(decision, reason)` became
// `return block(reason)` / `return allow()`. Block message text is preserved
// verbatim; migration-apply-guard.test.mjs asserts on it.

// Every check above this point reasons about caller-supplied values: `name`,
// `query`, and proof files keyed off them. None of them ever asked the question
// underneath all of it — IS THIS SQL A MIGRATION THIS REPOSITORY ACTUALLY HOLDS?
// A caller could paste the body of a parked, superseded or REJECTED draft under
// a canonical-looking name, mint matching proofs against that same text, and every
// binding would agree with itself. The bindings were sound; they were binding to
// nothing anchored on disk. (CodeRabbit Major, PR #525 — ruled out of scope there,
// real and pre-existing.)
//
// THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST, DELIBERATELY. The obvious shape — reject
// scripts/.staging-migrations/, reject a `.REJECTED` suffix — is a blocklist, and
// this repo has paid for blocklists repeatedly: the PR #401 guard region reopened
// on a new PL/pgSQL assignment form every round until it was pinned as a closed
// region (DECISION_LOG 2026-08-25), and three successive hand-written parsers in
// bash-safety-lib each left a real destructive bypass before an allowlist held
// (KNOWN_ISSUES, 2026-08-31: eight holes across five rounds). A suffix rule closes
// `.REJECTED` and leaves `.rejected`, `.REJECTED.sql`, a copy in the scratchpad,
// a temp directory, and text that was never a file at all.
//
// So the rule states the permitted case instead: the transmitted SQL must be the
// exact content of `<checkout>/supabase/migrations/<name>.sql`. One directory, and
// one filename inside it derived from the ledger name the apply itself declares.
// Everything else fails by construction, including sources nobody has enumerated.
//
// The name→file→content chain is what makes it worth having. It binds the ordering
// gate's input (`name`) to the bytes being transmitted (`query`) through an artifact
// that is tracked, reviewable, and diffable — so "which migration is this?" and
// "what will actually run?" can no longer disagree.
//
// SCOPE, matching the proof lookup exactly: this session's own checkout and the
// primary one, never a sibling worktree. Same reasoning as the proof directories
// above — a file sitting in a DIFFERENT concurrent session's worktree is not this
// session's reviewed work, and Mason runs dozens of worktrees at once.

// (KNOWN_ISSUES: stale-worktree CRLF). Comparing raw bytes would refuse a
