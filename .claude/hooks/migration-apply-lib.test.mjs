// These are deliberately NOT "does it say yes when everything is fine" tests. A
// guard that has only ever been observed passing has not been tested — the thing
// that matters is that each check REFUSES when the condition it exists to detect
// is present. So every case below starts from a known-good fixture, breaks
// exactly one thing, and asserts the refusal.
//
// The one ALLOW assertion per rule-set is load-bearing too: without it a guard
// that refuses everything unconditionally would pass every deny case and still be
// broken (and would quietly make the second door useless).
