// treatment, so it still carried the original. Reproduced by EXECUTION against
// this file's own exported predicates at 336f92e4d (2026-09-07), not by reading
// the pattern: `git.cmd push origin HEAD:main`, `git.ps1 …`, `git.com …`,
// `git.bat …`, `C:\Tools\git.cmd push …` and `"C:/…/git.cmd" push …` ALL
// returned isGitPush === false, so the guard exited before the force,
// destination, risky-diff and Codex-proof checks. `.cmd` is what Windows
// resolves `git` to when Git ships its shim, and PATHEXT is user-configurable,
// so this was not a corner case.
//
// Listing more extensions would inherit the next list's omissions. The binary is
// described by SHAPE instead, reusing PR #607's model verbatim rather than
// inventing a second grammar for the same problem — two different answers to
// "what is a git command" across two guards is how the next gap appears:
//
//   BIN_TAIL   what may sit between the NAME and the whitespace before the
//              subcommand, and it is exactly two things:
//                (a) an EXTENSION — a `.` followed by the LAST dot-segment of
//                    the final path segment, so it contains no separator, no
//                    further dot and no quote. ANY such extension, because "what
//                    follows the dot" is a shape, not a list: `.exe`, `.EXE`,
//                    `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.com` and whatever PATHEXT gains
//                    next all match without being named.
//                (b) a CLOSING QUOTE — a quoted command word ends with one, and
//                    `"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe" push` is the ordinary
//                    Windows spelling of a path containing a space.
//
// `\b` after the name is what keeps it off the neighbours: `-` is not `.`, so
// BIN_TAIL never opens on `git-crypt`/`git-lfs`, and `h` is a word character, so
// `\b` never even matches inside `github-release`/`gitfoo`. Bounding the
// extension (no dot, no separator, no quote inside it) is also what keeps this
// LINEAR — an unbounded tail can swallow the rest of the command and hand it
// back one character at a time at every position where the name can start.
// Measured, not assumed; the test file pins a ceiling.
//
// The path-prefix alternatives stay because CMD_START below anchors immediately
// before this pattern, so (unlike #607, which has no such anchor) `\b` alone
// cannot open on the BASENAME of `C:\Tools\git.cmd`. They lose only their
// extension list, not their structure.

  // Each option is read ATOMICALLY (`(?=(?<gitOpt>…))\k<gitOpt>` — JavaScript has

// guard run: 32M of that product takes ~65 ms at worst, while `git -C ` repeated
// to 64 KB (~600M) took ~11 s. The guards refuse a command above the budget

// `me""rge`, `me''rge`, `"merge"`, `me\rge` and `"me"rge` all arrive at gh as
// the single word `merge` — and a parser comparing the word as typed matches
// none of them. Measured through evaluateProductionAction and the merge guard,
// not read off a pattern: `gh pr me""rge 123 --squash` and
// `gh api --met""hod=POST …` both returned blocked:false.
//
// This is NOT a blanket removal of quotes and backslashes. That would be a
// second bug in the opposite direction (CodeRabbit, PR #630): `--method='P"OST'`
// really does pass `P"OST` to gh, so erasing the quotes would read it as POST
// and deny a call that is not a POST at all. Only syntax the shell CONSUMES is
// removed; a quote or backslash that survives to the program survives here:
//
//   * outside quotes — `\` escapes the next character, `'` and `"` open a quote
//     context and are themselves consumed;
//   * inside single quotes — everything is literal until the closing `'`, `\`
//     included (POSIX gives single quotes no escape at all);
//   * inside double quotes — `\` escapes only `"`, `\`, `` ` `` and `$`;
//     before anything else BOTH characters are literal, which is what keeps a
//     double-quoted Windows path (`"C:\tmp\x.json"`) intact;
//   * an UNTERMINATED quote runs to the end of the word rather than being
//     dropped — the fail-closed reading, since the alternative is to stop
//     recognising a keyword because a quote was left open.
//
// Backslash escapes are POSIX; PowerShell leaves `\` literal. Reading them as
// escapes is therefore the fail-closed direction for keyword comparison — it can
// only make a gate RUN on a word PowerShell would have left alone — and that is
// why this is used for subcommands, option names and the HTTP method, never for
// free-form values such as `--repo`, a body field, or a destination path, where
// a Windows separator must survive verbatim.
//
// ghMergeRequest has done a blunt version of this inline for flag NAMES since
// Codex's P1 on PR #541. That fix stopped at flag names: the `pr`/`merge`

// `https://github.com/owner/repo` — the SAME repository, reached the same way,
// which is the entire purpose of that rewrite. The two reads differ as strings,
// so an ordinary feature-branch push from any SSH-remote checkout in a web
// session was still denied. Verified by reproduction: an HTTPS-remote checkout
// (which is what this repo happens to use, and why the first round of testing
// missed it) was allowed while `git@github.com:` and `ssh://git@github.com/`
// spellings were both denied.
//
// So destinations compare by REPOSITORY IDENTITY, not spelling. Two URLs are the
// same destination when they name the same repository AND both arrive over a
// transport from the sanctioned set below. Anything else — a different
// repository, a proxy host, a downgraded or unrecognised transport — has no
// canonical form here and falls back to its raw text, which then differs from
// the other side and denies. Fails CLOSED by construction: `null` from
// `canonicalRepoId` (unparseable, malformed escape, no repository named) also
// falls back to raw text rather than comparing equal to anything.
// Reworked 2026-08-05 (Mason's call) after FOUR consecutive review findings in
// three rounds, each a new way two different destinations collapsed to one key:
// the SSH re-spelling gap, a dropped port, a namespace collision between keys and
// their raw fallback, and a lowercased path that merged `Team/Repo` with
// `team/repo` on case-sensitive hosts. A fifth was self-inflicted — the port rule
// would have denied `ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/…`, GitHub's own documented
// endpoint for networks blocking port 22.
//
// The leaks were characteristic of the approach, not bad luck: reconstructing
// "same repository" from URL text means re-deriving, by hand, every rule git and
// the host apply — case, ports, escapes, aliases, IDN, traversal. Get one wrong
// and two destinations merge.
//
// So stop trying to prove two URLs are the same place, and prove the opposite
// instead: that NOTHING about the destination moved. Each push line emits two
// components — the gate classification (`guarded-app` / `unrelated`, from
// `urlIsGuardedApp`, which fails CLOSED on anything it cannot resolve) and a
// spelling key from `pushDestinationKey` — and the comparison denies when either
// changes.
//
// An earlier version of this rework compared the classification ALONE, reasoning
// that a port or a path case may differ freely as long as neither side is the
// production repo. That was fail-open twice over and is documented at
// `pushDestinationKey`: `urlIsGuardedApp` is path-only by design, so an off-HOST
// rewrite read as production on both sides and compared equal; and a
// feature-branch push is not gated at all, so this comparison is the only thing
// protecting it.
//
// What that means concretely: two different non-GitHub URLs produce two different
// raw keys and DENY, even when neither is the production repo — a changed host,
// path case, SSH login user, port, or scheme all survive into the key. Only the
// allow-listed GitHub spellings collapse. A destination that is unreadable or
// fails closed keys off its own raw text, so it stays distinct from every
// resolvable destination rather than quietly matching one.

// moving a push to another HOST folded to the same answer on both sides, and a
// comparison that sees no change allows. Failing closed there fails OPEN here.
// Found by running the real guard against a real off-host rewrite; the unit tests
// and three review rounds all missed it.
//
// So spelling collapses in exactly one place — GitHub, whose repository paths are
// genuinely case-insensitive and whose alternate hostnames GitHub itself
// publishes (`ssh.github.com:443` is its documented port-22-blocked endpoint).
// That covers the case this rework exists for: a credential proxy re-spelling
// `git@github.com:owner/repo` as `https://github.com/owner/repo`, the same
// repository reached the same way.
//
// Everything else compares by RAW TEXT, so a changed host, path case, SSH login
// user, or port all differ and deny. Both reviewers of this change were right and
// were asking for the same boundary from opposite sides: CodeRabbit, that a
// lowercased path merges `Team/Repo` with `team/repo` on case-sensitive servers;
// Codex, that a dropped SSH user merges `alice@host:repo` with `bob@host:repo`.
// Neither can happen now, because off GitHub nothing is normalised at all.
//
// The cost is a false DENIAL if a proxy re-spells a non-GitHub remote. That is the
// safe direction, it does not affect this repo (whose remote is GitHub), and the
// deny message says which lookup disagreed.
// The GitHub carve-out is an ALLOW-LIST of spellings, not "any URL whose path
// canonicalizes under github.com". Keying on the canonical id alone was still too
// loose (CodeRabbit, 2026-08-05): `canonicalRepoId` reads `URL.hostname`, which
// drops the port, and it does not look at the scheme at all — so
// `https://github.com:8443/…`, `http://github.com/…` and `git://github.com/…` all
// produced the SAME key as plain HTTPS. An inherited rewrite from HTTPS to any of
// them changed the endpoint or downgraded the transport while the comparison saw
// no change. Same failure as the off-host hole one round earlier: a normalizer
// built for gating, reused for comparison, discards exactly what comparison needs.
//
// Only these spellings collapse, because only these are GitHub reached the normal
// way: HTTPS on the implicit or explicit 443, SSH on the implicit or explicit 22,
// `ssh.github.com` on an explicit 443 (GitHub's documented endpoint for networks
// blocking 22), and the scp-style `git@github.com:owner/repo`. The SSH user must

// destination. Codex's seventh 2026-07-30 review found this.
//
// Note the asymmetry that decides the shape of the fix: this only works when the
// override reaches the PUSH but not the GUARD, i.e. when it is written into the

// both, so the guard reads the very config the push will use and classifies the
// destination correctly — which is why this half needs no environment check, and
// why `environmentCarriesConfigOverride` above stays scoped to `GIT_CONFIG*`.
// The lookbehind excludes a preceding path separator, and that exclusion is
// load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The match is case-insensitive (PowerShell
// spells it `Env:userprofile`) and matches bare text anywhere in the command, so
// before 2026-08-05 the plain Unix path `/home/user/repo` matched `HOME` — which
// denied `git -C /home/user/CRX_Manager_V1.0 push`, the exact form this guard's

// Top-level command segmentation, quote-aware.
//
// Splitting on a bare regex splits INSIDE a quoted value, and that is not a
// cosmetic difference: `gh pr merge 123 --body 'note&more' --admin --squash` is
// ONE command to every shell, but a regex split hands the parsers
// `gh pr merge 123 --body 'note` — a merge with no `--admin` — and puts the
// override in a second segment that contains no `gh` at all. A green
// normal-merge gate then authorizes an administrator merge (Codex sol,
// 2026-09-08, SEC-001; introduced by this branch when `&` became a separator).
//
// Only UNQUOTED separators split. An unterminated quote runs to the end of the
// input, which yields a LONGER segment.
//
// A LONGER segment is NOT automatically the safe direction, and believing it was
// is what round four got wrong (Codex sol, 2026-09-09, finding 2, measured).
// The parsers read the FIRST command of a segment, so joining two commands hides
// the SECOND one just as surely as splitting hides the tail of the first:
//
//   git push origin HEAD:feature \| git push origin HEAD:main
//
// PowerShell does not treat `\` as an escape, so that is a real pipeline whose
// second half pushes main. Honouring the escape produces one segment whose first
// command is a harmless feature push.
//
// Splitting can hide a command and joining can hide a command, so no single
// reading is safe and this returns the UNION of two:
//
//   1. the shell-accurate walk — quotes and escapes honoured, so a quoted or
//      escaped separator does not sever a command and strand its options;
//   2. a NAIVE walk — every separator character splits, whatever quotes or
//      escapes surround it, so nothing a quote or escape could hide stays
//      hidden.
//
// Where the shells agree the two readings are identical and de-duplicate to one.
// Where they disagree, both meanings get inspected. Both call sites are
// `for (const segment of ...)` loops hunting for an offence, so an extra reading
// can only add inspection.
//
// A third reading — the WHOLE command, unsplit — was tried and REMOVED. It is
// load-bearing for nothing: when the accurate walk yields one segment it IS the
// whole command, and when it yields several the concatenation is a string no
// shell runs as a single command. It also cost a real duplicate: it re-parsed a
// chained merge as one more merge and fired the Codex advisory a third time for
// `gh pr merge 123 --squash && gh pr merge 456 --squash`.

// on 2026-09-02 because a stuck or un-run CodeRabbit review blocked landings
// that were otherwise green, and the only way past it was his manual
// administrator override — a control no agent may use.

// unresolved objection. CHANGES_REQUESTED means a reviewer looked and said no,
// so it still hard-denies. Every other verdict — APPROVED, REVIEW_REQUIRED, and
// the null GitHub now returns when no review is required — allows the merge,
// because "nobody has reviewed this yet" is no longer a server-side blocker.

// treating it as a block would restore exactly the deadlock this removed. The
// fail-closed floor lives upstream instead — gateRequest() denies outright if
// the PR's JSON cannot be fetched at all, so this predicate is never reached
