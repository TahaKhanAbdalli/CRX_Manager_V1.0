// suite's assertions are `ok(isDeny(r), ...)`, and a spurious fail-closed block
// SATISFIES every one of them for the wrong reason. The handful of allow-
// assertions are therefore the entire detection surface for a guard that has
// started refusing when it should not.
//
// That makes their failure message load-bearing. Asserting the negated deny
// predicate directly throws with the label alone: it says an allow was expected
// and a deny arrived, and nothing about WHICH block fired — so the one signal
// the suite has is the one signal that cannot be read. Observed 2026-09-07:
// `Phase 3C Containment
// (Windows)` on PR #592 at 4cb4cb674 failed the "restored fresh proofs allow
// again" case and then passed on a re-run of the identical commit. Branch
// content, every expiry window, leftover fixture state and local slowness were
