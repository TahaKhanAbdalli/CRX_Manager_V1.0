// ── gate ORDERING, pinned on both guards ─────────────────────────────────────
// This pin was INVERTED on 2026-09-03 by Codex round 6, and the reason matters
// more than the direction.
//
// It originally required the App-review check to run FIRST, so an unanswered
// review comment would be the message the reader got rather than "wait for CI".
// That reasoning was about message quality. The cost was a security hole: this
// lookup is advisory, fail-open, and costs up to four `gh` calls each capped at
// 10s, against hook budgets of 15s (Codex) and 30s (Claude). A PreToolUse hook
// killed mid-call emits nothing, and a hook that emits nothing does NOT deny —
// the class PR #502 established. So a slow GitHub could starve every HARD
// denial that came after it: CHANGES_REQUESTED, the green pipeline, the
// risky-diff classification, and the exact-SHA Sol proof.
//
// The advisory therefore runs LAST, at the points where the alternative is
// returning ALLOW anyway. Both properties are pinned below, because each one
// alone is satisfiable by a broken guard:
//   * ordering — every hard denial precedes the advisory, so none can be starved;
//   * REACHABILITY — the advisory is still actually invoked, or this is the dead
//     code the original pin existed to prevent (it sat behind the Codex guard's
//     approval deny and never ran for any PR without a formal approval).
// Measured at the CALL, not the definition: `function codexAppAdvisory({ request`
// matches the same prefix and now sits textually before the call, so a bare
// indexOf would measure the wrong thing and pass no matter where the call lands.
//
// There are TWO call sites since Codex round 9: the GitHub-connector merge tool
// (one PR per call, so its allow point is right there) and the shell drain
// after the segment loop. The ordering pins below measure the LAST one — the
// shell drain — because that is the one a regression would move back inside
// the loop; the connector site is pinned separately for reachability.
