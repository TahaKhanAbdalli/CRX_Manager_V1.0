// Shared predicates for the Codex GitHub App's automated pull-request review
// (`chatgpt-codex-connector`), so the merge gates can stop treating it as
// invisible. Added 2026-09-02.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The Codex App has been reviewing every PR in this repo since it was enabled
// in the ChatGPT Codex cloud settings, and NOTHING in this repository read its
// output: a grep for `chatgpt-codex-connector` across hooks, skills, commands,
// scripts and docs returned zero hits before this file. It posts a summary
// comment and, when it has suggestions, a real review — into a void.
//
// That was survivable while main required an approval CodeRabbit had to grant.
// It stopped being survivable on 2026-09-02, when the Claude-side merge gate
// downgraded "no current approval" from a deny to a printed notice. An
// automated review that nobody reads is now worse than no review: it renders a
// green check on the PR page that reads as coverage.
//
// THE TWO SPELLINGS OF THE BOT'S NAME  (both verified live 2026-09-02)
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//   `gh pr view --json reviews`  -> author.login === "chatgpt-codex-connector"
//   REST .../pulls/<n>/reviews   -> user.login   === "chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]"
// Matching one spelling and not the other is the silent-failure mode for this
// whole file: the predicate finds no bot reviews, reports "nothing to see", and
// every merge sails through looking checked. Both spellings are pinned in the
// tests, and the GraphQL thread path uses the bare spelling.
//
// WHY THIS READS THREADS, NOT REVIEW OBJECTS  (measured, not assumed)
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// The first cut of this file blocked on "the bot submitted a COMMENTED review
// whose commit oid is the head". Running that against all 10 open PRs on
// 2026-09-02 flagged SIX of them, which sent me to look at why:
//
//   PR #547  13 Codex reviews, one per commit, newest at the head
//   PR #530  19 Codex reviews, newest at the head
//   PR #516  23 Codex reviews, newest at the head
//
// The App's own "About Codex in GitHub" blurb lists its triggers as PR-opened,
// draft-marked-ready, and an `@codex review` comment — it does NOT mention
// pushes. The blurb is not what the App actually does: it re-reviews on
// essentially every push. So a COMMENTED review object sitting on the head is
// the ORDINARY state of an active PR, not a signal that anything is wrong.
//
// Worse, a review object has no exit. You cannot resolve one; the bot simply
// posts another on the next push. A gate keyed to it could never be satisfied —
// exactly the deadlock that got main's required review relaxed the day before.
//
// The signal that carries real information is the REVIEW THREAD, and its
// `isResolved` flag. Same six PRs, counted at thread level:
//
//   PR   codexThreads  codexUnresolved  unresolvedAtHead
//   449      24              1                1
//   530      40             40                1
//   535       7              7                2
//   547      19              1                1
//   556       1              1                1
//   544       5              5                1
//
// PRs #449 and #547 show 24 and 19 Codex threads with ONE unresolved each:
// people really do work these threads, so resolution state distinguishes
// "handled" from "standing". And the gate's unit of work is 1-2 items with a
// clear exit — fix it, or resolve the thread with a reason.
//
// DELIBERATE FAIL-OPEN — READ BEFORE "HARDENING" THIS
// @speed-bump — this layer raises the cost of merging over an unread Codex
// finding. It is NOT a boundary, and nothing here should be described as one.
// ---------------------------------------------------
// @speed-bump — the surrounding hard gates (CI's required checks, the exact-SHA
// gpt-5.6-sol proof) are the boundary; this predicate never carries that weight.
// Almost every other predicate in this repo fails closed. This one does not,
// and that is deliberate (Mason chose the narrow-block option on 2026-09-02).
// This layer is an honest-mistake net for an ADVISORY reviewer; the hard gates
// are elsewhere and unchanged — CI's required checks, and the exact-SHA
// `gpt-5.6-sol` proof `pr-merge-guard.mjs` demands for a risky diff. So every
// uncertainty here degrades to a loud notice, never to a locked door:
//
//   findings-at-head : >=1 UNRESOLVED Codex thread anchored to THIS head
//                      -> DENY. It flagged this exact code and nobody
//                         answered. Exit: fix it, or resolve the thread.
//   stale            : it has threads, but none unresolved at this head -> NOTICE
//   none             : no Codex threads / the data could not be fetched -> NOTICE
//   clean-at-head    : it reviewed this head and nothing is outstanding -> silent
//
// Thread reads page up to CODEX_THREAD_MAX_PAGES (see collectCodexThreads).
// Beyond that a PR could hide an unresolved thread, which loses a DENY rather
// @speed-bump — losing a DENY is the failure mode; this is not a boundary.
// than inventing one — the safe direction for a fail-open gate.

// Both API spellings, lowercased. `[bot]` is a suffix GitHub's REST API adds
// and `gh`/GraphQL strip; neither is more canonical than the other.

// `originalCommit.oid` is the commit the thread was FIRST left on, which is what

// Walk up to CODEX_THREAD_MAX_PAGES pages of review threads and return a single

//
// `runQuery(cursor)` performs one GraphQL request and returns the parsed
// `pullRequest` node (or null/undefined). The caller owns transport, so the
// Claude and Codex guards can each use their own gh runner without forking this
// paging logic.
//
// Added after a Codex review of this file's own PR flagged the unpaginated
// single-page read (CRX-REV-002): on a PR with more than 100 threads the
// unresolved one could sit on a page nobody fetched, and the gate would report
// "nothing standing" while something was.
// `deadlineMs` is an ABSOLUTE epoch-millisecond cap on the whole walk, checked
// before every request including the first. Exceeding it THROWS rather than
// returning what has been read so far: a partial read is indistinguishable from
// @proven-by codex-bot-review-lib.test.mjs — "an exceeded deadline THROWS
// (callers turn that into their fail-open notice) rather than returning a
// partial read as clean"
// a clean one, and this predicate's callers turn a throw into their fail-open
// notice. Returning early with `nodes` would instead report "nothing standing"
// while a finding sat on an unfetched page — the exact defect CRX-REV-002 fixed.
//
// It exists because this lookup runs inside a PreToolUse hook with a hard outer
// timeout (15s for the Codex guard, 30s for Claude's). A hook killed mid-call
// emits nothing, and a PreToolUse hook that emits nothing does NOT deny — so an
// @speed-bump — the deadline keeps this advisory from starving the hard gates;
// the budget is a cost control, not a boundary of its own.
// unbounded advisory lookup is a fail-open on every HARD gate that would have
// run after it (PR #502 established this class; Codex round 6 found this
// instance). The callers additionally run this only after their hard denials,
// so the ordering does not depend on this budget being right.
//
// `incomplete` (Codex round 11, Medium): the walk can also END without
// concluding — a later page comes back null, the server claims hasNextPage
// with no usable cursor, or the page cap is reached with more pages behind
// it. Those used to return what had been read as if it were everything, so a
// resolved thread on page one plus an unresolved one on page four read as
// "clean-at-head". The result now carries `incomplete: true` on every such
// path, and evaluateCodexBotReview() refuses to call an incomplete read clean:
// a standing finding it DID see still blocks, but anything short of that is
// reported as "incomplete" so the callers print a notice instead of nothing.
