// prompts — EXCEPT the deny-set below, which stays blocked. The genuinely

// settings.json permissions.deny + bash-safety/migration-apply-guard, so this is
// defense in depth, not the only line.

// Tool NAMES that must never be auto-approved during an unattended run: live
// prod mutations and branch/project lifecycle ops. Matched case-insensitively
// against the (possibly MCP-prefixed) tool name.
//
// NOTE (Mason, 2026-07-10, explicit + repeated): apply_migration and execute_sql
// are DELIBERATELY NOT in this set — Mason owns this live DB and does not want SQL
// or migration applies to gate during an unattended run. They remain protected by
// the migration-apply-guard hook (settled 2026-07-13: an armed apply needs a fresh
// hash-bound reviewer proof naming BOTH rls-security-reviewer and
// migration-drift-reviewer PLUS a fresh hash-bound codex-review-mig-<name>.json
// Codex proof, ≤30 min each; destructive migrations are refused outright while
// armed) and by settings.json permissions.deny. Deploys, pushes,
// branch/project lifecycle, and destructive file/db ops STAY blocked here.

// `git` and `gh` accept GLOBAL OPTIONS BETWEEN the binary and the subcommand
// (`git -C <dir> push`, `gh -R <owner>/<repo> pr merge`). A bare `git\s+push`
// cannot span them, so those shapes were AUTO-APPROVED while armed — armed mode
// did not actually prevent pushing or merging (found 2026-09-05, by running the
// guard against a corpus rather than by reading it).
//
// The first fix ENUMERATED the option spellings (`-[cC]\s+\S+|--\S+` for git,
// `-[RFf]\s+\S+|--repo\s+\S+|--\S+` for gh) and so inherited that list's
// omissions — the name-listed-carve-out failure this repo keeps re-learning. Two
// shapes walked straight through it, both reproduced by EXECUTION (2026-09-07):
//
//   git -C "C:/CRX Manager/wt" push …    `\S+` stops at the first space, and CRX
//                                        worktrees sit under a path with a space
//   gh -Rmasonwells1/CRX_Ma… pr merge …  `-[RFf]\s+` demanded a DETACHED value;
//                                        attached short values are normal usage
//
// So the option region is described by SHAPE now, not by spelling. Two token
// classes and nothing else:
//
//   OPT_TOKEN  a shell word STARTING WITH `-`. Everything after the dash is just
//              "more word", so `--force`, `-Rowner/repo`, `--repo=owner/repo`,
//              `--git-dir="C:/CRX Manager/.git"` and `-C"a b"` are one token each
//              with no special case per spelling.
//   VAL_TOKEN  a shell word NOT starting with `-`: an option's detached value.
//
// A shell word is a run of quoted sections (which MAY contain spaces),
// backslash-escaped characters, and ordinary characters. That is what closes the
// quoting hole for every option at once instead of for the ones someone listed.
//
// This is still not `.*`, and the benign controls are why. The region ends at the
// first word that is neither an option nor an option's value — and that word is
// the subcommand. `git commit -m "fix the push bug"` opens with `commit`, which is
// not an OPT_TOKEN, so the region is EMPTY and the pattern then needs `push` where
// `commit` stands; the `push` inside the quoted message is never reachable from
// this `git`. Only a leading `-` opens the region at all. Both directions are
// asserted in autopilot-lib.test.mjs, including the two bypasses above.
//
// KNOWN, MEASURED over-denial — the whole class, not one example. When a global
// option does not consume a detached value (it takes none, or carries its value
// attached), the SUBCOMMAND is the next bare word and can be consumed as that
// option's value instead. The deny word two tokens later then matches:
//
//   git --no-pager log --grep push        `log` consumed as --no-pager's value
//   git -C/x stash push -m w              `stash` consumed as -C/x's value
//   git --git-dir=/x/.git stash push      same, attached long value
//
// A differential sweep of 1,728 generated commands (both binaries x 36 option
// regions x 24 subcommand tails) put this at 43 benign commands newly denied
// against 188 dangerous shapes newly closed. The common spellings are NOT among
// the 43 — `git -C /x stash push -m w` and `git log --grep push` both stay
// allowed, because a detached value or a non-option first word ends the region.
//
// Separating them needs per-option ARITY, which is another name list — the thing
// that just failed twice here. For a DENY set an occasional extra denial is the
// safe side of that trade, so it is taken deliberately and asserted below.
//
// `\s` (not `[^\S\r\n]`) is deliberate: these are DENY patterns, so treating a
// newline as separation makes them broader, never narrower.

// The BINARY was the third axis of the same bug, and the widest one. `\bgit\b`
// followed by `${GLOBAL_OPTS}\s+` requires whitespace immediately after the NAME,
// so anything the shell still resolves to git — an extension, a closing quote —
// ended the match before the subcommand was ever considered. Reproduced by
// execution at e0bce4a82 (2026-09-07): `git.exe push origin HEAD`,
// `git.exe push --force`, `git.exe reset --hard origin/main` and
// `gh.exe pr merge 625 --squash` all returned "allow" while the bare spellings
// denied. `.exe` is the NATIVE binary spelling on the platform this repo is
// developed on, so this defeated the whole deny-set, not a corner of it.
//
// Listing the extensions (`\.exe|\.cmd|\.bat`) is the name-listed carve-out that
// already failed twice in the option region above — PATHEXT is user-configurable
// and `.com`, `.ps1`, a wrapper script with no extension at all, and whatever the
// next shell adds are not in anyone's list. So the binary is described by SHAPE:
//
//   NAME       the exact command name, with `\b` on both sides, so it cannot be
//              the tail or the head of a longer word (`gitfoo`, `github-cli`).
//   BIN_TAIL   what may sit between that name and the whitespace before the
//              subcommand, and it is exactly two things:
//                (a) an EXTENSION — a `.` followed by the LAST dot-segment of the
//                    final path segment, so it contains no separator, no further
//                    dot and no quote. Any such extension, because "what follows
//                    the dot" is a shape, not a list: `.exe`, `.EXE`, `.cmd`,
//                    `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.com` and whatever PATHEXT gains next all
//                    match without being named.
//                (b) a CLOSING QUOTE — a quoted command word ends with one, and
//                    `"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe" push` is the ordinary
//                    Windows spelling of a path that contains a space.
//
// Bounding the extension that way is also what keeps this LINEAR. A first draft
// let the extension be any run of word chunks, which let it swallow the rest of
// the command and then give it back one character at a time — at every one of the
// many positions where `\bgit\b` can start. Measured, not reasoned about: a
// 20,000-character `git.git.git…` string took 414ms to decide, against 0-2ms for
// every realistic input. With the extension bounded there is nothing to give back,
// and the same string decides in under a millisecond. The test file pins a ceiling.
//
// A PATH PREFIX is deliberately in this same class and needs no new syntax: a
// path separator is a non-word character, so `\b` already opens on the final
// segment. `/usr/bin/git push`, `./git push`, `C:\Tools\git.exe push` and
// `"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe" push` are all matched at the basename —
// which is what the shell resolves too. That was verified by execution, not
// assumed; the pre-fix library already denied the unquoted, extensionless path
// forms for exactly this reason.
//
// It does NOT widen onto neighbours, and `\b` plus "an extension starts with a
// dot" is why. `git-crypt push`, `git-lfs push`, `github-release push`,
// `gitfoo push`, `npm run gitpush`, `gh-dash pr merge 1` and `ghq push` all stay
// allowed: `-` is not `.`, so BIN_TAIL does not open, and the required whitespace
// then lands on `-crypt`/`-lfs`/`-dash` instead of on the subcommand. Asserted in
// both directions in autopilot-lib.test.mjs.
//
// KNOWN over-denial, same trade as the option region: a quoted word that ENDS in
// `git`/`gh` now also satisfies BIN_TAIL's closing quote, so `grep "git" push.log`
// denies. The UNQUOTED twin `grep git push.log` already denied before this change,
// so this makes the guard consistent rather than newly blunt, and an extra denial
// is the safe side for a deny set.
// CASE was the fourth axis of the same bug, and on this platform the widest one
// left. `bin()` embedded a LOWERCASE literal into a case-SENSITIVE RegExp, but
// Windows resolves command names case-insensitively: `GIT push`, `Git.exe push
// --force`, `GH pr merge 625 --squash` and `GIT reset --hard origin/main` all run
// the same programs. Reproduced by RUNNING autopilotDecision at 6600a825b — every
// one of those returned "allow" while its lowercase twin denied, so armed mode did
// not prevent pushing, force-pushing, merging or hard-resetting. Raised by
// CodeRabbit on PR #607.
//
// ONLY THE NAME IS FOLDED, and that boundary is not cosmetic — it is the whole
// reason this is safe:
//
//   the BINARY NAME is resolved by the FILESYSTEM/shell, which is
//     case-insensitive on Windows      -> fold it
//   the SUBCOMMAND and the OPTIONS are parsed by git/gh/supabase THEMSELVES,
//     which are case-SENSITIVE everywhere (`git PUSH` is "not a git command",
//     `--NO-VERIFY` is not a flag)     -> do NOT fold them
//
// So a whole-pattern `i` flag would be both wrong and dangerous here. Wrong,
// because it makes the guard claim to catch `git PUSH`, which is not a command.
// Dangerous, because `i` collapses `-C` and `-c` inside GLOBAL_OPTS' nested
// quantifiers — the exact collision this pattern family already has a measured
// ReDoS on. Inline `(?i:...)` is not supported by this Node's RegExp engine, so it
// is not an option either. Folding the name means rewriting each of its letters as
// a two-character class, which is O(1) per position exactly like the literal it
// replaces: the pathological-input measurements below are unchanged by it.
//
// This is a RULE, not a list. `foldCase` derives the classes from whatever name it
// is given, so every current and future caller of `bin()` is covered without anyone
// enumerating spellings. That was checked the only way it can be — by running the
// decision function against mixed-case spellings deliberately kept OUT of both this
// file and the test file, so nothing here could be matching them by having written
// them down. They deny; a mixed-case benign command still allows. Enumerating
// spellings instead would be the name-listed carve-out that has already failed
// three times in the comments above, which is why no example is written here.

// Every OTHER name-anchored rule below had the same binary hole, for the same
// reason — the name is followed by a required `\s`, so an extension ends the match
// before the dangerous subcommand is read. `supabase.exe db reset`,
// `vercel.cmd deploy`, `npx.cmd supabase db reset` (npx.cmd IS the Windows npx)
// and `rm.exe -rf` all walked through. They take the same shape rule rather than

//
// `rmdir`, `dropdb` and `createdb` are deliberately NOT changed: they are bare
