// cannot span them, so those shapes were AUTO-APPROVED while armed — armed mode
// did not actually prevent pushing or merging (found 2026-09-05, by running the
// guard against a corpus rather than by reading it).
//
// The first fix ENUMERATED the option spellings (`-[cC]\s+\S+|--\S+` for git,
// `-[RFf]\s+\S+|--repo\s+\S+|--\S+` for gh) and so inherited that list's
// omissions — the name-listed-carve-out failure this repo keeps re-learning. Two
// shapes walked straight through it, both reproduced by EXECUTION (2026-09-07):
//
//   git -C "C:/CRX Manager/wt" push …    `\S+` stops at the first space, and CRX
//                                        worktrees sit under a path with a space
//   gh -Rmasonwells1/CRX_Ma… pr merge …  `-[RFf]\s+` demanded a DETACHED value;
//                                        attached short values are normal usage
//
// So the option region is described by SHAPE now, not by spelling. Two token
// classes and nothing else:
//
//   OPT_TOKEN  a shell word STARTING WITH `-`. Everything after the dash is just
//              "more word", so `--force`, `-Rowner/repo`, `--repo=owner/repo`,
//              `--git-dir="C:/CRX Manager/.git"` and `-C"a b"` are one token each
//              with no special case per spelling.
//   VAL_TOKEN  a shell word NOT starting with `-`: an option's detached value.
//
// A shell word is a run of quoted sections (which MAY contain spaces),
// backslash-escaped characters, and ordinary characters. That is what closes the
// quoting hole for every option at once instead of for the ones someone listed.
//
// This is still not `.*`, and the benign controls are why. The region ends at the
// first word that is neither an option nor an option's value — and that word is
// the subcommand. `git commit -m "fix the push bug"` opens with `commit`, which is
// not an OPT_TOKEN, so the region is EMPTY and the pattern then needs `push` where
// `commit` stands; the `push` inside the quoted message is never reachable from
// this `git`. Only a leading `-` opens the region at all. Both directions are
// asserted in autopilot-lib.test.mjs, including the two bypasses above.
//
// KNOWN, MEASURED over-denial — the whole class, not one example. When a global
// option does not consume a detached value (it takes none, or carries its value
// attached), the SUBCOMMAND is the next bare word and can be consumed as that
// option's value instead. The deny word two tokens later then matches:
//
//   git --no-pager log --grep push        `log` consumed as --no-pager's value
//   git -C/x stash push -m w              `stash` consumed as -C/x's value
//   git --git-dir=/x/.git stash push      same, attached long value
//
// A differential sweep of 1,728 generated commands (both binaries x 36 option
// regions x 24 subcommand tails) put this at 43 benign commands newly denied
// against 188 dangerous shapes newly closed. The common spellings are NOT among
// the 43 — `git -C /x stash push -m w` and `git log --grep push` both stay
// allowed, because a detached value or a non-option first word ends the region.
//
// Separating them needs per-option ARITY, which is another name list — the thing
// that just failed twice here. For a DENY set an occasional extra denial is the
// safe side of that trade, so it is taken deliberately and asserted below.
//
// `\s` (not `[^\S\r\n]`) is deliberate: these are DENY patterns, so treating a
// newline as separation makes them broader, never narrower.

// The BINARY was the third axis of the same bug, and the widest one. `\bgit\b`
// followed by `${GLOBAL_OPTS}\s+` requires whitespace immediately after the NAME,
// so anything the shell still resolves to git — an extension, a closing quote —
// ended the match before the subcommand was ever considered. Reproduced by
// execution at e0bce4a82 (2026-09-07): `git.exe push origin HEAD`,
// `git.exe push --force`, `git.exe reset --hard origin/main` and
// `gh.exe pr merge 625 --squash` all returned "allow" while the bare spellings
// denied. `.exe` is the NATIVE binary spelling on the platform this repo is
// developed on, so this defeated the whole deny-set, not a corner of it.
//
// Listing the extensions (`\.exe|\.cmd|\.bat`) is the name-listed carve-out that
// already failed twice in the option region above — PATHEXT is user-configurable
// and `.com`, `.ps1`, a wrapper script with no extension at all, and whatever the
// next shell adds are not in anyone's list. So the binary is described by SHAPE:
//
//   NAME       the exact command name, with `\b` on both sides, so it cannot be
//              the tail or the head of a longer word (`gitfoo`, `github-cli`).
//   BIN_TAIL   what may sit between that name and the whitespace before the
//              subcommand, and it is exactly two things:
//                (a) an EXTENSION — a `.` followed by the LAST dot-segment of the
//                    final path segment, so it contains no separator, no further
//                    dot and no quote. Any such extension, because "what follows
//                    the dot" is a shape, not a list: `.exe`, `.EXE`, `.cmd`,
//                    `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.com` and whatever PATHEXT gains next all
//                    match without being named.
//                (b) a CLOSING QUOTE — a quoted command word ends with one, and
//                    `"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe" push` is the ordinary
//                    Windows spelling of a path that contains a space.
//
// Bounding the extension that way is also what keeps this LINEAR. A first draft
// let the extension be any run of word chunks, which let it swallow the rest of
// the command and then give it back one character at a time — at every one of the
// many positions where `\bgit\b` can start. Measured, not reasoned about: a
// 20,000-character `git.git.git…` string took 414ms to decide, against 0-2ms for
// every realistic input. With the extension bounded there is nothing to give back,
// and the same string decides in under a millisecond. The test file pins a ceiling.
//
// A PATH PREFIX is deliberately in this same class and needs no new syntax: a
// path separator is a non-word character, so `\b` already opens on the final
// segment. `/usr/bin/git push`, `./git push`, `C:\Tools\git.exe push` and
// `"C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe" push` are all matched at the basename —
// which is what the shell resolves too. That was verified by execution, not
// assumed; the pre-fix library already denied the unquoted, extensionless path
// forms for exactly this reason.
//
// It does NOT widen onto neighbours, and `\b` plus "an extension starts with a
// dot" is why. `git-crypt push`, `git-lfs push`, `github-release push`,
// `gitfoo push`, `npm run gitpush`, `gh-dash pr merge 1` and `ghq push` all stay
// allowed: `-` is not `.`, so BIN_TAIL does not open, and the required whitespace
// then lands on `-crypt`/`-lfs`/`-dash` instead of on the subcommand. Asserted in
// both directions in autopilot-lib.test.mjs.
//
// KNOWN over-denial, same trade as the option region: a quoted word that ENDS in
// `git`/`gh` now also satisfies BIN_TAIL's closing quote, so `grep "git" push.log`
// denies. The UNQUOTED twin `grep git push.log` already denied before this change,
// so this makes the guard consistent rather than newly blunt, and an extra denial
// is the safe side for a deny set.
// CASE was the fourth axis of the same bug, and on this platform the widest one
// left. `bin()` embedded a LOWERCASE literal into a case-SENSITIVE RegExp, but
// Windows resolves command names case-insensitively: `GIT push`, `Git.exe push
// --force`, `GH pr merge 625 --squash` and `GIT reset --hard origin/main` all run
// the same programs. Reproduced by RUNNING autopilotDecision at 6600a825b — every
// one of those returned "allow" while its lowercase twin denied, so armed mode did
// not prevent pushing, force-pushing, merging or hard-resetting. Raised by
// CodeRabbit on PR #607.
//
// ONLY THE NAME IS FOLDED, and that boundary is not cosmetic — it is the whole
// reason this is safe:
//
//   the BINARY NAME is resolved by the FILESYSTEM/shell, which is
//     case-insensitive on Windows      -> fold it
//   the SUBCOMMAND and the OPTIONS are parsed by git/gh/supabase THEMSELVES,
//     which are case-SENSITIVE everywhere (`git PUSH` is "not a git command",
//     `--NO-VERIFY` is not a flag)     -> do NOT fold them
//
// So a whole-pattern `i` flag would be both wrong and dangerous here. Wrong,
// because it makes the guard claim to catch `git PUSH`, which is not a command.
// Dangerous, because `i` collapses `-C` and `-c` inside GLOBAL_OPTS' nested
// quantifiers — the exact collision this pattern family already has a measured
// ReDoS on. Inline `(?i:...)` is not supported by this Node's RegExp engine, so it
// is not an option either. Folding the name means rewriting each of its letters as
// a two-character class, which is O(1) per position exactly like the literal it
// replaces: the pathological-input measurements below are unchanged by it.
//
// This is a RULE, not a list. `foldCase` derives the classes from whatever name it
// is given, so every current and future caller of `bin()` is covered without anyone
// enumerating spellings. That was checked the only way it can be — by running the
// decision function against mixed-case spellings deliberately kept OUT of both this
// file and the test file, so nothing here could be matching them by having written
// them down. They deny; a mixed-case benign command still allows. Enumerating
// spellings instead would be the name-listed carve-out that has already failed
// three times in the comments above, which is why no example is written here.

// THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO SHELL ESCAPE HATCH HERE (Mason, 2026-09-01).
//
// This gate used to allow any command containing `OVERNIGHT-INTENT.flag`, and the
// deny message told agents to delete that file from the shell. The command never
// worked: review-proof-guard.mjs (matcher "*") refuses every destructive shell
// command touching .claude/session-state. Since this gate also blocks Write and
// Edit, a session latched by MISTAKE — the latch fires on a prompt heuristic, so a
// prompt that merely DISCUSSES autopilot trips it — had no unblocked path left
// except arming autopilot, exactly the failure the handshake exists to prevent.
// autopilot-lib.test.mjs asserted that command was allowed, and passed for months,
// because it tested one hook of seven while the real chain denied it.
//
// A sanctioned `node scripts/clear-overnight-intent.mjs` escape was built and then
// REMOVED after two rounds of exact-SHA gpt-5.6-sol review found four HIGH
// bypasses in it: the allowance matched only BASENAMES (any planted file with that
// name ran), and then, once tightened to exact strings, it was still unbound to the
// project root (a planted `scripts/…` under a different cwd ran instead), while the
// helper itself could be edited locally before invocation. Every fix was a new
// text-matching rule on a command string — the shape this repo has already proven
// does not converge (the `git clean` carve-out closed after six rounds).
//
// The trade was rejected on its merits: the disease is a session paused for at most
// INTENT_FRESH_MS; the cure was a fresh way to EXECUTE CODE during precisely the
// window when execution is meant to be paused. The residual is deliberate — wait
// out the 45-minute expiry, or have Mason delete the flag himself (his shell is not
// gated by these hooks). Do NOT arm autopilot to get unblocked, and do NOT
// reintroduce a command allowance here without re-reading that review history.
// overnight-intent-clear.test.mjs holds the deny message to this contract.

// The arm command is the ONE command allowance, and it is anchored to a complete,
// standalone invocation. A bare `/autopilot-arm\.mjs/` substring test let the
// allowance ride on a chained command — `npm run build && node
// .claude/hooks/autopilot-arm.mjs --hours 8` returned allow-through, so the BUILD
// ran during the pause and the arm was merely along for the ride (CodeRabbit,
// PR #548). Anchored start-to-end with no shell metacharacters admitted, so a
// prefix, a suffix, or a chain cannot ride it.
//
// FORWARD SLASHES ONLY. An earlier revision also accepted the Windows backslash
// spelling, which CI caught as a genuine cross-platform bug: on Linux `` is not a
// separator, so `.claude\hooks\autopilot-arm.mjs` is ONE filename and never
// resolves to the trusted path. Normalizing backslashes would be worse than
// rejecting them — on Linux a file literally named `.claude\hooks\autopilot-arm.mjs`
// is creatable, and normalizing would match it against the trusted path while Node
// executed the literal-backslash file instead. Node accepts forward slashes on
// Windows, and forward slashes are the spelling both the deny message and
// autopilot-arm.mjs's own header document, so this costs nothing: one canonical
// shape, one slot to reason about.
//
// HORIZONTAL whitespace only (`[^\S\r\n]`, not `\s`). `\s` matches CR and LF,
// which are shell command separators, so the anchor accepted multiline commands
// (Codex gpt-5.6-sol, 2026-09-02, Low). The end anchor stops a second command from
// being appended — `--off\nnpm run build` fails `[^\S\r\n]*$` — so this was not
// exploitable, but the same `\s`-swallows-newlines mistake DID produce a real
// bypass in review-proof-guard's cd scanner, where two invocations merged into
// one. That guard uses `[^\S\r\n]` for exactly this reason; match it here rather
// than rely on the anchors holding forever.
//
// The accepted arguments are exactly what autopilot-arm.mjs documents at its head:
// a bare invocation, `--hours <n>`, `--off`, and `--status`. A first draft of this
// anchor admitted only integer `--hours` and omitted `--status` entirely, which
// BROKE two documented commands — `--status` is read-only and is precisely what a
// paused agent should be able to run to see whether autopilot is armed (Codex
// gpt-5.6-sol, exact-SHA review 2026-09-01: "blocks the CLI's documented read-only
// --status command and fractional --hours values"). Hardening that quietly removes
// a working command is a regression, not a win. `--hours` is clamped to
// [0.25, 24] in the CLI, so fractional values are legitimate.
