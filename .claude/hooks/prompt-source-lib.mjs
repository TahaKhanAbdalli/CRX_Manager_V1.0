// isMachineGenerated(prompt): the phrase hooks exist to react to things MASON
// actually typed. But UserPromptSubmit also fires for machine-built prompts —
// <task-notification> digests, <system-reminder> context blocks, slash-command
// expansions (<command-name> / <local-command-stdout>). Proven 2026-07-04: a
// <task-notification> carrying an audit report tripped dangerous-phrase-warning,
// codex-gauntlet-reminder, ship-intent-reminder, autopilot-intent-reminder AND
// latched hold-latch-prompt's hold.json — all on text Mason never wrote.
// This check is deliberately conservative: it only flags prompts that carry a
// known machine-envelope tag, so a normal typed sentence can never match.
//
// PUSH_POLICY: the ONE canonical statement of the push policy, imported by every
// hook that injects it. Three hooks used to carry their own stale copy ("do not
// push without Mason's explicit approval") that contradicted the authorized
// auto-push — a single shared constant means the wording can't drift again.

// KEEP THIS LIST CURRENT. Every entry here was added because a real automated
// prompt was mistaken for something Mason typed. The 2026-07-04 incident above
// recurred on 2026-08-16 for exactly the same reason: <heartbeat> — the envelope
// the crx-active-session-fleet-monitor automation arrives in — was not listed,
// so its <instructions> body latched hold.json three times in one session and
// blocked an approved live migration apply, with no human involved.
//
// Audited the project's transcripts (786 user-prompt records) after that
// incident to find every tag that actually opens a prompt here. Four were
// missing from this list; three are added below. The tags that open a prompt in
// practice are: task-notification, scheduled-task, system-reminder,
// local-command-caveat, command-name, cross-session-message, heartbeat.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT LISTED: "cross-session-message". A sibling Claude/Codex
// session is behind that envelope, not the harness, so unlike the entries below
// there IS an agent choosing the words. Listing it would stop a sibling from
// latching a hold on this session — a loosening, not a tightening — and that is
// Mason's call to make, not this file's. Left out on purpose; do not "complete"
// the list from the audit above without asking him first.
//
// MASON ANSWERED (2026-08-26), and the answer was NOT "add it to this list".
// Adding it here would make a whole prompt inert — so a message where Mason
// typed "pause" AND pasted/received a peer block would stop latching, which is
// exactly the direction he forbade. The answer is authoredByMason() below:
// the peer's words are REMOVED from the text, and whatever Mason typed around
// them is still matched normally. See that function for the incident.

// isMachineGenerated() above is an all-or-nothing gate: the WHOLE prompt is the
// harness's, so ignore the WHOLE prompt. That is right for a <heartbeat> digest
// and wrong for the case below, where one prompt mixes Mason's words with words
// he did not write.
//
// INCIDENT (2026-08-26, reproduced in BOTH directions). A coordinator session
// sent a peer a <cross-session-message> discussing a PR escalation path, using
// the words "stand down ... no need to stop the other lane". The PEER's hold
// latched, as though Mason had told it to halt. The peer quoted the phrasing
// back in its reply; the COORDINATOR's hold then latched on the same words.
// It escalated from there: naming the hook file itself was enough, because
// "stop-wrap.mjs" contains "stop" between word boundaries. Net cost — two
// sessions burned round-trips inventing substitute vocabulary ("the brake",
// "frozen/released") just to discuss the guard, and one sat idle with finished
// work because there was no message it could safely receive.
//
// Root cause: trigger-word matching read the ENTIRE inbound prompt, including
// envelope blocks that are DATA (another agent's words) and quoted spans where
// Mason is REPORTING a phrase rather than issuing it.
//
// This returns the prompt with the not-Mason spans removed, so the phrase
// matchers see only what he actually typed. It NARROWS THE INPUT ONLY — it does
// not touch the trigger vocabulary and does not soften any latch. Mason's own
// "stop" / "pause" / "hold on" / scope-only wording still fires exactly as
// before, including when it shares a message with a stripped block.
//
// Order matters, and the order below was corrected on 2026-09-21 (#504b).
//
// The original order ran fences FIRST, so that a fence containing a bare
// envelope OPEN tag could not trip the unterminated-envelope rule below and
// swallow the rest of the prompt. That protected a prompt Mason wrote, and
// broke one he received: an unterminated ``` fence INSIDE a peer envelope ran
// past the peer's own closing tag and consumed everything after it — including
// the "stop" Mason typed below the peer's message. A real halt then matched
// nothing. Fail-OPEN on the halt path, which is the wrong direction.
//
// So CLOSED envelopes come out first, whole: a peer's unfinished markdown
// cannot reach past the closing tag that ends that peer's own turn. Fences run
// next, on what is left, which still shields a quoted open tag from the
// unterminated-envelope rule — the case the original order existed for. Then
// inline code (`stop-wrap.mjs`), then any UNCLOSED envelope, then blockquotes.
//
// That order alone has its own hole (2026-09-24 review): an open tag Mason
// quotes in code pairs with a real peer's closing tag further down, and his
// "stop" between them is cut out. The original code-first order handles that
// shape. authoredByMason() therefore runs BOTH orders and keeps what either
// keeps — see the note above it.
//
// Residual, accepted deliberately: a peer that writes a fake closing tag inside
// its own message ends its envelope early, so peer words after the fake tag are
// read as Mason's and can latch a hold he did not ask for. That is the
// fail-SAFE direction (a spurious pause costs a round-trip; a missed "stop"
// does not stop), and it is how this file already behaved before #504b. It
// stays fail-safe even when the peer follows its fake tag with an unterminated
// fence, because stripFencedCode() gives an unclosed fence's lines back instead
// of dropping the rest of the prompt.

// INCIDENT (2026-09-25). A background subagent's final report reached its parent
// session wrapped as
//     Another Claude session sent a message:
//     <\~agent-message from="<agent id>">
//     [Subagent hand-back] ...indented report...
//     <\~/agent-message>
// None of that was recognised, so the report was read as Mason's words: a "stop"
// in it latched hold.json, a quoted `--no-verify` fired dangerous-phrase-warning,
// and the ship / autopilot / gauntlet reminders fired too. The hold then blocked
// source edits until Mason replied.
//
// A hand-back is recognised by its LINE STRUCTURE, not by tag pairing. The
// harness always puts the preamble line in front of it, writes the open and
// close tags alone on their own lines at column zero, and indents every line of
// the report itself; only its own frame lines ("[Subagent hand-back] ...",
// "[harness: ...]") sit at column zero inside. So a block is:
//   1. the preamble, with the open tag after it on the same line or on the next
//      non-blank line (indentation allowed), and — outside STRICT mode — a
//      "[Subagent hand-back]" / "[harness" frame as the next non-blank line, so
//      only the exact harness shape is ever taken away from Mason;
//   2. then the run of blank / indented / frame lines after the open tag, plus
//      a column-zero close-tag line directly after that run. The first other
//      column-zero line ends the block. When the open tag itself was indented,
//      an indented close-tag line ends it too.
//   3. STRICT mode only: everything from the hand-back to the end of the
//      prompt. Every other preamble LINE is dropped whole, words after it
//      included.
// The two modes follow the union / intersection split below (Luna review,
// 2026-09-26). A truncated report followed by Mason's "stop now" and then a
// close tag is indistinguishable from a closed report with one unindented line.
// Latching and the reminders use rule 2, so his stop is never swallowed; the
// latch also keeps a report with no close tag whole (see keepTruncated below).
// hasAuthoredText() uses rule 3, so no report layout can count as Mason
// speaking and CLEAR a hold he latched.
// Defects of the earlier rules (Claude review + Luna review, 2026-09-25) that
// cannot happen under this one:
//   - a close tag the REPORT quotes is indented, so it cannot end the report
//     early and expose the rest of it as Mason's words;
//   - a tag Mason MENTIONS, or a wrapper he types without the harness preamble,
//     is not a block, and a truncated report ends at the next column-zero line,
//     so none of them can swallow the "stop" he typed. Pairing to end-of-prompt
//     did exactly that, and so did accepting an open tag with no preamble.
//
// The tag carries a "~" sigil, and the copy in the incident report had it
// backslash-escaped (the harness neutralises control tags by inserting "\"),
// with the sigil in front of the "/" on the close. Both tags accept any number
// of backslashes and an optional "~". The tag name must end at whitespace or
// ">", so `<agent-message-log>` is not an open tag, and the tag must be ALONE
// on its line: `<agent-message> stop now </agent-message>` is Mason's text.
// Column zero only: a preamble the REPORT quotes is indented, and must not be
// taken for the start of a new message (Luna review round 4, 2026-09-26).
