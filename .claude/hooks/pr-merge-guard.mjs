// PreToolUse(*) guard: gate PR merges into main the way codex-push-guard gates
// pushes to main. Added 2026-07-16 (scaffolding design review, Theme 1): the
// 2026-07-14 `protect-main` ruleset made direct pushes to main impossible, so
// the landing action moved to `gh pr merge` / the GitHub MCP merge tool — and
// Claude's risky-diff Codex gate never followed. This hook closes that gap:
//
//   * merge into main → allowed only under Mason's autonomous-landing rule
//     (2026-09-26): CodeRabbit APPROVED the exact head, the newest run of every
//     check is green with mergeStateStatus CLEAN, and a fresh gpt-6-sol/high
//     Codex proof is bound to that head and GitHub's real base (minted only by
//     scripts/write-codex-push-proof.mjs — hand-writing is blocked). Every diff
//     needs the proof, except a documentation-only one as defined in
//     sol-exempt-lib.mjs (Mason, 2026-10-07);
//   * `--auto` into main → denied, because it lands later-pushed commits after
//     this gate has run (Codex round-4 finding);
//   * `--admin`, CHANGES_REQUESTED, GraphQL mergePullRequest, raw REST merges and
//     unresolvable PR context → denied, fail closed.
//
// Mirrors .codex/hooks/production-action-guard.mjs's merge route (the Codex
// side has had this gate since 2026-07-14). Shared parsing/validation lives in
// codex-push-lib.mjs — one pattern table, no forked logic.
//
// This is an honest-mistake net, not a security boundary: GitHub branch
// protection (required Vercel check) remains the external hard wall.

//
// Deliberately a SEPARATE gh call rather than extra fields on the shared PR
// resolve: `gh pr view` has no reviewThreads field at all (verified — "Unknown
// JSON field"), so thread resolution state only comes from GraphQL. Keeping this
// self-contained also keeps the shared resolve line conflict-free for the other
// in-flight guard work.
//
// @speed-bump — advisory by design; it raises the cost of merging over an unread
// Codex finding, it is not a boundary. The hard gates are CI's required checks

// Fail-OPEN by design: any failure here leaves codexVerdict null, which prints a
// notice and merges. See the header of codex-bot-review-lib.mjs for why this one
// predicate does not fail closed like its neighbours.
