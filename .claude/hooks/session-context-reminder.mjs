// SessionStart hook: inject the project context reminders as additionalContext.
//
// Replaces two former `"type": "prompt"` hooks (the PreCompact money/RLS
// re-anchor and the SessionStart onboarding prompt). Prompt-type hooks only
// work in the interactive REPL — in the desktop app / SDK harness they fail
// with "Prompt stop hooks are not yet supported outside REPL", so both were
// silently dead there (observed live 2026-08-18; also the source of the
// hook_error noise on startup/resume in transcript telemetry). A command hook
// printing that text through SessionStart additionalContext works on the one
// harness this hook is wired to (Claude only — it is declared in CLAUDE_ONLY_HOOKS
// and is absent from .codex/hooks.json; verified on the desktop harness 2026-08-18).
// Only the old PreCompact re-anchor's rules half was carried forward here (as
// COMPACT_REANCHOR, fired on source === "compact"), and not verbatim: the old
// prompt's "Always include these reminders:" connective became the "POST-COMPACT
// RULE RE-ANCHOR" header, .update/.delete gained parentheses, one semicolon became
// a period, and the "treat files changed before the compact as UNVERIFIED" rule is
// new here, with no ancestor in the old prompt. Otherwise the rules text is
// carried over byte-for-byte.
// The old prompt's other half — its opening summarizer instruction — was dropped
// with no replacement. Reasoning (not measured): additionalContext on a SessionStart
// source === "compact" fires after the compact has run, so it cannot shape the
// summary. The repo records no test of whether a PreCompact *command* hook could
// have carried that half.
//
// Branches on the SessionStart payload's `source`:
//   compact              → the money/idempotency/RLS re-anchor
//   startup/resume/clear → the onboarding reminder
//
// FAIL-OPEN: any error → emit nothing. A reminder must never brick a session.
