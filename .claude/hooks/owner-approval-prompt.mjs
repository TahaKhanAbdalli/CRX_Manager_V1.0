// UserPromptSubmit half of Mason's owner approval (owner-approval-lib.mjs;
// Mason 2026-10-09: replaces Windows Hello so he can approve from his phone).
//   - His WHOLE message is `approve <6-digit code>`, in the session that built the
//     pending request with that code (scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs) → the
//     request becomes an approval good for 30 minutes, and the agent is told so.
//   - Any other message, or the reply in another session → nothing is approved.
// Claude Code runs this on each message sent into a session. Nothing stops an
// agent running it by hand with a made-up message; that is the deliberate
// forgery Mason accepted as the residual (owner-approval-lib.mjs header).
