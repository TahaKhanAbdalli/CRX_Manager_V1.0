// PreToolUse guard for Supabase MCP `apply_migration` calls.
// Refuses to let Claude apply a migration to live unless proof exists that the
// review subagents (rls-security-reviewer + migration-drift-reviewer) have run
// THIS SESSION on that specific migration and returned clean.
//
// Proof = a file at .claude/session-state/migration-review-<safe-name>.json
// with structure:
//   { "migration": "<filename or migration name>",
//     "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
//     "reviewers": ["rls-security-reviewer", "migration-drift-reviewer"],
//     "findings": "clean" | "blockers-fixed" }
//
// The file is written by Claude after subagents return clean. Without it, this
// hook blocks the apply_migration call with explicit instructions.
//
// Setup matcher: in .claude/settings.json this hook is registered against matcher
// "mcp__.*apply_migration" with onFailure "block" (2026-10-23: loading the rule
// book cost ~250 ms on every MCP call, and a crashed or timed-out run allowed the
// apply); .codex/hooks.json registers it under "mcp__.*". Either way it filters
// in-script for tool names containing "apply_migration".
//
// THE RULES THEMSELVES LIVE IN ./migration-apply-lib.mjs (2026-08-24). This file
// is now only the transport: read the PreToolUse payload, ask the shared rule
// book for a verdict, emit it. scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs asks the SAME
// rule book, which is how an oversized migration — one that cannot be re-emitted
// byte-exact through this tool's pasted `query` parameter — reaches live without
// any gate being skipped or duplicated. Do not reintroduce check logic here.
