/**
 * F1 — the idempotency key must outlive the result check.
 *
 * A mutating RPC's reply is only known-good once assertRpcResult has accepted it.
 * Retiring the key before that check means an AMBIGUOUS reply — an empty (null)
 * success payload after the server may already have committed — leaves the user's
 * retry travelling under a FRESH key, which the server cannot replay, so the work
 * is applied twice (a duplicate invoice, a double-allocated payment, a double credit).
 *
 * Part 1 proves the semantics on the real hook + the real assertRpcResult.
 * Part 2 is a repo-wide guard so the ordering cannot silently regress.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS OF THIS FILE — stated rather than papered over, because a guard that
 * is trusted beyond its reach is worse than one whose blind spots are written down
 * (all three raised by the Codex gpt-5.6-sol review of this change, 2026-09-03):
 *
 *  1. `assertRpcResult` rejects only null/undefined — it does NOT validate shape, so
 *     "the reply is verified" means "not empty", not "well-formed". A path needing a
 *     real shape check must do it itself and retire the key after it (see
 *     MonthEndClose's Array.isArray check).
 *  2. Part 2 matches on LINE ORDER and cannot bind a call, its reset and its assert to
 *     the same control-flow branch. A reset in an `else` arm whose sibling arm asserts
 *     will pass. That exact shape was a live HIGH in InvoiceDetail's edit path, and it
 *     was caught by REVIEW, not by this guard — which is why the per-RPC shape pin in
 *     src/lib/idempotencyIntentBindingMigration.test.ts also exists.
 *  3. Part 1 models the corrected call-site sequence; it does not execute any
 *     production handler, so it cannot detect branch placement or click-level
 *     rotation. Those are covered by Part 2's source checks and by driving the real
 *     screen in a browser.

 * whole file, so any future bug added to an allowlisted file would have been hidden.
 * A file now only excuses the reasons it declares, and each hit must independently
 * exhibit that reason:
 *
 *  - `recovery`  — the reset sits in an `if (error)` recovery branch. Three intended
 *    flavors: `getIdempotencyMismatchResult` returned a COMMITTED receipt (the outcome
 *    is known, so the key is properly retired and the app reopens the committed record
 *    rather than duplicating it), `isDefinitiveRpcRejection` (server definitively
 *    refused, nothing committed), or `getIdempotencyBindingRejection` (the stored key
 *    is bound to a different intent/actor, or its receipt is unusable — nothing
 *    committed under it, so it must be retired for the retry to mint a fresh one).
 *    "Fixing" these breaks duplicate recovery.
 *  - `throw-on-error` — the RPC RETURNS void and is called with `.throwOnError()`, so
 *    the promise rejects on any error and the reset is only reachable on success.
 *    There is no payload to assert.
 *  - `intent-rotation` — the reset runs from a JSX `onClick`/`onChange`, deliberately

 * they cannot use a stripper that blanks strings; that would erase the very token they
 * search for. They still must not be satisfiable by prose, which is what this removes.
 * Quotes are tracked (not blanked) so a `//` inside a string is not mistaken for the
 * start of a comment.
 *
 * NOT HANDLED, stated rather than fixed (gpt-5.6-sol round 4, which exercised these
 * directly). This is a scanner, not a TypeScript lexer:
 *  - a REGEX LITERAL containing a quote — `const p = /['"]/;` — opens a false string
 *    state, so a comment on the following line survives;
 *  - a `//` inside a template literal's `${...}` interpolation survives, because the
 *    whole template is copied without parsing the interpolation;
 *  - strings are deliberately KEPT (the pins locate a call by its RPC name), so three
 *    ordinary string constants naming the call, the assert and the reset would still
 *    satisfy all three offsets.
 *
 * So this raises the bar from "any comment satisfies the pin" to "only a contrived
 * regex/template construct or a deliberate set of string constants does". It is not
 * proof of executable order — that needs the TypeScript AST, which belongs to its own
 * change rather than to this one. The behavioural tests in QuoteBuilder.test.tsx and
 * CustomerDetail.test.tsx are what actually prove the ordering; these pins exist to
 * make a silent revert loud.

/**
 * Mask everything that is not executable code, for classify()'s look-back windows.
 *
 * Comments, string contents, template-literal text and regex-literal bodies become spaces.
 * Newlines are kept, so line i of the result is still line i of the input. Unlike
 * stripCommentsOnly() and the per-line stripNoise(), this tracks all four across lines, so
 * a regex literal on the line above a reset, or a template literal spanning several
 * lines, cannot supply the text classify() accepts as evidence (CodeRabbit, PR #638).
 * A template's `${…}` interpolation is code and stays visible. A quote that is not closed
 * on its own line ends at the line break, so JSX text such as `Don't` cannot mask the
 * lines after it.
 *
 * A `/` opens a regex only where an expression can start: at the beginning, after one of
 * `( , = : [ ! & | ? { ; + - * % ~ ^`, after `=>`, or after a keyword such as `return`.
 * A word whose nearest non-space character before it is `.` is a property name, not a keyword,
 * so `obj.return / 2` and `obj?.typeof / 2` stay division (CodeRabbit, PR #668).
 * Anywhere else it is division, and so is a candidate that reaches a line break before its
 * closing `/`. A `)` counts only when it closes an `if`, `for` (including `for await`), `while`, `switch` or `catch`
 * head — never a method named like one, such as `helpers.if(a)` — so a regex written as a control
 * statement's BODY is masked while division after an ordinary `)` is not (CodeRabbit, PR #638). This is still a scanner, not a TypeScript lexer:
 * a regex written after `]`, `}` or `<` is read as division and its text stays visible, as it
 * always was, and a `//` inside JSX text still masks the rest of its line.

   *
   * SCOPE OF THIS PR, narrowed 2026-09-03 after the round-2 Codex review found the

   * when the route id is the WHOLE of what a retry can vary — not merely the record
   * the RPC names. Round 4's HIGH: complete_delivery also sends the signature,
   * per-item quantities and issue notes, so a route-scoped retained key would replay
   * the FIRST payload while the screen reported the edited one. Route scope binds the
   * record; it does not bind the payload.
   *   - DeliveryDetail — create_followup_delivery ONLY. Its payload is exactly
   *     (p_original_delivery_id, p_performed_by, p_idempotency_key). cancel, void and
   *     complete send mutable free-text or quantity fields and stay in main's order.
   *   - InvoiceDetail — transfer_invoice_to_job sends the route id. saveIdem is absent
   *     because it is already record-scoped via its second argument.
   *   - FieldApplicationInvoice — delete_invoices sends [id] and
   *     transfer_invoice_to_job sends id, both the route id.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT here, because route-id scoping would NOT match what the RPC
   * targets and would give false assurance — these pages were reverted to main and are
   * tracked as follow-up: QuoteBuilder (RPCs target component state `quoteId`, and
   * `/quotes/new` has no id at all), BlendTicketDetail (RPCs target asynchronously
   * hydrated `ticket.id`), and every page whose intent lives in an in-page payload
   * rather than the route — PrepayWorkspacePanel, Deliveries batch cancel, Invoices
   * batch void/delete, PaymentAllocation, FinanceChargePreviewModal, Quotes,

   * `loading` is only ever set false (line 98 initialises it true; nothing sets it true again),
   * so on A -> B navigation the page keeps rendering A's data — button live — while the route
   * id is already B. `consolidate_draft_invoices` is the one order action whose request sends
   * the LOADED `order.id` rather than the route `id` (its siblings at update/cancel/create/
   * split all send `id`), so in that window it would send A under a key scoped to B, and B's
   * own later retry would replay A's cached receipt.
   *
   * CLAIM LIMITED: this is a LEXICAL check that the equality guard appears between the handler
   * and its RPC call, in EXECUTABLE code — comments and string literals are blanked first
   * (CodeRabbit round 3), so prose quoting the guard no longer satisfies it. It still does not
   * execute the handler, does not prove React state timing, and cannot see a guard that is
   * present but unreachable. What it buys is that deleting or loosening the guard, replacing it
   * with a comment, or moving the RPC call above it, fails immediately.
   *
   * The two offsets are located in the RAW source so the RPC name inside its string literal is
   * still findable; a comment forging an earlier call site only SHRINKS the searched region and
   * therefore fails closed.

 * F1, ALIASED-RESET CLASS — the sites that name the hook's method through a
 * destructured rename (`const { resetKey: resetSaveQuoteIdempotencyKey } = ...`).
 * The original F1 sweep matched the literal spelling `resetKey()` and therefore could
 * not see any of them; both defects below were live on main after #584 shipped.
 *
 * Each test pins the PAIR rather than one half of it. That distinction is the whole
 * point here: "an assertRpcResult appears near this reset" is satisfied BY THE BUG,
 * because the buggy order still has the assert — one line below instead of above. The
 * property that separates fixed from broken is ORDER, so order is what is asserted.
 *
 * CLAIM LIMITED: these are lexical source checks over a located region. They do not
 * execute the handlers, so they cannot prove branch reachability or React state
 * timing. What they buy is that reverting either reset to its old position, deleting
 * the emptiness test that replaces an assert in the early-return branch, or renaming a
 * key out from under the pin, fails immediately rather than silently.
