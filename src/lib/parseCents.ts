/**
 * Parse a dollar string into a non-negative cents integer (safer default).
 *
 * Strips currency formatting, decimals, and any sign characters — the result
 * is always >= 0. Use this for money inputs that are semantically positive:
 * payment amounts, write-offs, prices, credit limits, claim amounts, prepay
 * balances, etc. Negative input is treated as a typo/garbage and clamped:
 *   "25.50"  → 2550
 *   "$1,234.56" → 123456
 *   ""       → 0
 *   "-100"   → 10000   (sign stripped — positive semantics enforced)
 *   "1e5"    → 0       (scientific notation rejected)
 *   "1.2.3"  → 0       (multi-dot rejected)
 *   "1.999"  → null    (more than two decimals REFUSED — see MONEY_PRECISION_MESSAGE)
 *
 * null is the only "refused" signal. It is deliberately not 0, because most
 * callers save the returned number directly and a 0 has a real meaning at
 * many of them (no credit limit, cleared price override, $0 prepay balance).
 * Every caller checks for null before saving and shows MONEY_PRECISION_MESSAGE.
 *
 * Use `parseDollarsToCentsSigned` for the few fields that legitimately accept
 * negative input (vendor bill adjustment_cents, discount fields). Those are
 * the only callsites where -100 means "subtract $1".
 *
 * Codex P2 fix (PR #59, 2026-05-13): previously, this function preserved the
 * sign. Most callers don't revalidate, so e.g. CustomerDetail's Credit Limit
 * input stored a negative credit_limit_cents, and `create_quick_delivery`
 * then skips the credit check when limit ≤ 0. Making positive the default
 * closes that latent bypass.
