/**
 * Source guard for the Section 07 gauntlet HIGH finding: the commission payout
 * RPCs keyed their idempotency receipts on [operation, user] only, so a
 * retained browser key could replay a DIFFERENT payout's cached success.
 * 20260811130000 binds each receipt to the acting user and a hash of the exact
 * request. These assertions keep both halves — the SQL wrappers and their
 * page-level callers — from silently losing that binding.
 *
 * Behaviour is proved separately, against a real Postgres, by
 * scripts/smoke/prove-commission-payout-intent-binding.mjs. This file only
 * guards the structure those runtime proofs depend on.
