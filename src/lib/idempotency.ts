/**
 * Deterministic fingerprint of the payload a retained key was minted for.
 *
 * useIdempotencyKey retains one key per intent scope so a lost response can be
 * replayed safely. That is only correct while the scope still identifies the
 * SAME work: if a scope is built from position and name alone, a later action
 * carrying different content reuses the earlier key and replays the earlier
 * receipt. Appending this fingerprint to the scope makes changed content mint a
 * fresh key, while a true retry of unchanged content keeps replaying.
 *
 * FNV-1a is a local lookup hash, not a security boundary. This mirrors
 * pendingBulkPOIntentStorageKey in src/lib/bulkPOImportRetry.ts, which uses the
 * same hash for the same local-identity purpose.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT — do not read more protection into this than it gives. For RPCs
 * that bind the actor and payload server-side, this is only a local convenience
 * and the server remains the authoritative duplicate check. But several call
 * sites deliberately target RPCs that replay on the KEY ALONE — `retire_inventory_item`
 * and `save_blend_recipe` say so in their own comments (live catalog read
 * 2026-09-20: key-only check_idempotency, no actor/payload binding). For those,
 * this 64-bit
 * digest is the ONLY thing separating two different payloads, and some of the
 * fingerprinted payloads include operator-entered free text.
 *
 * `adjust_inventory` and `create_inventory_hold` are NO LONGER in that set: both
 * bind the actor and a payload fingerprint server-side through
 * check_idempotency_intent (holds applied 2026-09-15, adjustments 2026-09-20), so
 * for those two the server — not this digest — is the boundary.
 * Accidental collision is negligible at these volumes; a deliberate one is not
 * structurally prevented. Do not widen this function's use to a new key-only RPC
 * without either a collision-resistant digest or server-side payload binding.
