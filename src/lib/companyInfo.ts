/**
 * Single source of truth for company identity shown on customer-facing and
 * internal PDFs (invoices, statements, quotes, delivery receipts, etc.).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: before the 2026-05-29 review, each PDF module hardcoded the
 * company location as a string literal, and they had drifted — invoices/
 * statements/year-end said "Martinsville, IL" while quotes/deliveries/order
 * summaries said "Robinson, IL". A customer could receive a quote from one town
 * and an invoice from another. Now the location lives here once.
 *
 * FUTURE: SettingsPage already stores company_name/phone/email/address; a later
 * change should thread those values in here so the address is editable from the
 * UI without a code change.
