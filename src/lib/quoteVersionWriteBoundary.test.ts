/**
 * CRX-SEC-1 — quote_versions write boundary.
 *
 * public.quote_versions.snapshot_data became an AUTHORITATIVE cost source in
 * 20260812115236: restoring a version stamps quote_items.cost_at_quote_cents
 * from snapshot_data.sections[].items[].current_cost, convert_quote_to_order copies that
 * into the order's immutable cost snapshot, and profit and commissions derive
 * from there. So a client-writable path into this table is a path into
 * commission money.
 *
 * 20260813080000 makes writes RPC-owned. This suite is the shape guard for the
 * three artifacts that enforce that, in the same pattern as
 * returnWriteBoundary.test.ts: the migration, the standing drift predicate, and
 * the behavioural smoke. It reads files — it does NOT prove live state. The
 * predicate proves live privileges; the smoke proves live behaviour.
