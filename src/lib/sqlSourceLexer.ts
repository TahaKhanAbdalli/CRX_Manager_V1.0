/**
 * A small Postgres source lexer, shared by the migration-scanning test suites.
 *
 * Several tests protect money guards by reading the SQL that defines a payout
 * RPC and asserting the guard is still in it. Those tests are only as sound as
 * their reading of the source: a plain text search cannot tell live SQL from a
 * commented-out copy, from a string literal that merely quotes it, or from a
 * definition written `public."create_commission_payment"` instead of
 * `public.create_commission_payment`. Each of those confusions has a direction
 * that leaves the suite green over an unguarded production body.
 *
 * This module exists so there is exactly ONE such reader. It used to live
 * inside commissionPayoutGuards.test.ts while a second, weaker scan sat in
 * commissionPayoutIntentBindingMigration.test.ts; the two drifted, and the
 * weaker one missed forms the stronger one already handled.
 *
 * It is test infrastructure — nothing in the running application imports it.

/**
 * Lexes the file once so a scan reads SQL rather than text.
 *
 * Returns a MASK the same length as the input — every offset found in the mask
 * indexes straight back into the original — with two substitutions:
 *
 *  - Comments become spaces, everywhere. Postgres treats a comment exactly as
 *    whitespace, so a block comment sitting between CREATE and OR REPLACE still
 *    leaves a real definition that a whitespace-only regex walks straight past;
 *    and, in the other direction, a commented-out copy of a guarded definition
 *    must not be able to stand in as the file's "last definition" while the live
 *    one below it dropped the guard.
 *  - Single-quoted literals OUTSIDE a function body become spaces, so a string
 *    containing the text of a definition cannot impersonate one. Literals INSIDE
 *    a body are kept by default: the guards under test raise their error codes
 *    as string literals, and blanking those would blind the assertions. Pass
 *    `blankBodyLiterals` for the code-only view — see codeOnly().
 *
 * `spans` records where the dollar-quoted bodies and the blanked top-level
 * literals are, so a definition's body can be bounded to its own statement.
 *
 * `idents` records double-quoted identifiers OUTSIDE a body. They are recorded
 * rather than blanked, because blanking them would hide a real definition
 * written as `CREATE FUNCTION "post_commission_payment"(...)` — the unsafe
 * direction. Recording them lets a scan refuse to read SQL keywords out of
 * them: `"as"` is a perfectly legal column name, and a `\bAS\b` that matched
 * inside one would anchor the body on whatever literal came next instead of on
 * the real body, reporting a guard that the live function does not have.
