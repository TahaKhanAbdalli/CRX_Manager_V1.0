/**
 * loaderWorksheet — the PURE per-load tank-split math for the field-job Loader
 * Worksheet (field-app parity #10).
 *
 * The loader worksheet tells the tank loader how many tank loads to mix for a job
 * and exactly how much of each chemical goes into ONE tank. The split is driven by
 * the job's total SPRAY VOLUME (total acres × the per-acre carrier/diluent rate)
 * and the sprayer's tank capacity:
 *
 *     spray volume (gal) = total acres × carrier rate (gal/acre)
 *     loads              = ceil(spray volume / tank capacity)
 *
 * Each FULL load carries `capacity` gallons of spray; the LAST load carries the
 * remainder (a "partial last load") when the volume doesn't divide evenly. Every
 * product on the job is split across the loads IN PROPORTION to each load's volume
 * fraction, so:
 *
 *     • a load that is `capacity / sprayVolume` of the job gets that fraction of
 *       each product, and
 *     • the per-load amounts for a product SUM EXACTLY to the product's job total
 *       (the last load takes the residual, so there is never an over- or under-fill
 *       from float drift — the same penny-exact-residual pattern the invoice split
 *       engine uses).
 *
 * This module is React- and jsPDF-free so the loads/partial/per-load arithmetic is
 * unit-tested in isolation (loaderWorksheet.test.ts). JobDetail renders the in-page
 * preview from it and the PDF layout (loaderWorksheetPdf.ts) prints from the same
 * computed result, so screen and paper never disagree.
