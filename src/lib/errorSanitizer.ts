  // disclosure for every caller of sanitizeError, not only the ones added in the
  // 2026-09-02 sweep; those merely lost the canned-literal accident that had been
  // hiding it. The repo's own fixtures already used the real unquoted form
  // (criticalAction.test.ts, applicatorSheetPrintData.test.ts,
  // previousApplications.test.ts) — only this module's own test used the quoted
  // form, so the pattern was written against the test's fiction rather than
  // against what the database emits.
  //
  // Match the REGION (`permission denied for <anything>`) rather than enumerating
  // object types: Postgres has many (table, view, materialized view, foreign
  // table, sequence, function, procedure, schema, database, large object, ...) and
  // an enumeration silently reopens the hole for whichever one is missing. A bare
  // `permission denied` with no `for <object>` is left alone, so a hand-written
