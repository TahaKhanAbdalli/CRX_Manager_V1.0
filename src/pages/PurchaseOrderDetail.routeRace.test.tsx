/**
 * PurchaseOrderDetail — route-currency race.
 *
 * Every guard this file covers has been mutation-tested: broken one at a time,
 * watched failing, restored. The one guard that no longer reddens anything is
 * named in the changelog entry rather than left looking covered.
 *
 * React Router reuses this component when only the :id param changes, so a
 * query started for PO A can resolve after the operator has already navigated
 * to PO B. Before the fix, PO A's line-item query landing last overwrote
 * `items` while `po` stayed B: the screen showed B's PO number above A's line
 * items, and a receive submitted from there carried A's `po_item_id` values.
 * `receive_po_items` derives the affected PO from the submitted item ids and
 * has no expected-PO parameter, so the goods were booked against PO A while
 * the operator believed they were receiving PO B.
 *
 * This suite stubs `@supabase/supabase-js` rather than `../lib/db`, so the REAL
 * db.ts runs and the REAL `assertRpcResult` and `sanitizeError` are exercised.
 * Stubbing `assertRpcResult` as a passthrough (`(d) => d`) would silently delete
 * the ambiguous-reply path from every test in this file.
 *
 * Each guard gets its own test, so removing one guard turns exactly one test
 * red. A guard whose failure is carried by a neighbouring guard is untested.
