/**
 * JobDetail.staleLoad.test.tsx — cross-record stale-load contamination.
 *
 * ORIGINAL DEFECT: `jobs/:id` carried NO `key` prop, so changing only the id did NOT
 * remount JobDetail. The previous job's in-flight loads kept running after the operator
 * clicked into a different job, and their setters landed on the form now showing THAT job.
 * A save afterwards targeted the CURRENT route id while the form held the OLD record's
 * values — one job's data written onto another's row.
 *
 * IN PRODUCTION THE ROUTE IS NOW KEYED: `JobDetailRoute` renders `<JobDetail key={id} />`,
 * so a record change remounts. These tests mount JobDetail DIRECTLY and DELIBERATELY
 * WITHOUT that key, so they keep exercising the in-component guards the keyed route makes
 * redundant — that is what keeps them honest if the key is ever removed.
 * `JobDetailRoute.test.tsx` pins the key itself.
 *
 * Found by the exact-SHA gpt-5.6-sol review of PR #603 head 5dad64e2 (2026-09-05), rated
 * HIGH, pre-existing on main. Two sequences are covered here, one per open path:
 *
 *   1. /jobs/job-a -> /jobs/job-b with A's `jobs` read resolving LAST. Unguarded, fetchJob
 *      installs A's job number, status, dates and chemicals over B's loaded form.
 *   2. /jobs/new -> /jobs/job-b with the new-job run's lookups resolving LAST. Unguarded,
 *      the cancelled run continues past `await loadLookups()` into the `else` branch and
 *      clears B's grower-share names / vessel / tank capacity, then overwrites B's job
 *      number with the freshly minted next_job_number.
 *
 * Both gates are DEFERRED PROMISES, not timers: the ordering then holds on any machine at
 * any speed, rather than silently degrading into a test that proves nothing when the box
 * is slow. Confirmed 2026-09-05 that both tests FAIL against the unguarded source with the
 * production symptom (the heading shows the wrong job) and pass with the guard.

   * write UI/form state BEFORE fetchJob is ever called — `setIsDirty(false)` at the save,
   * complete, cancel and transfer sites. A stale handler resuming after the operator moved

   * nothing restores the dirty flag, because the dirty effect only recomputes on

   *
   * The consequence is silent data loss: B's unsaved edits stop being protected, so
   * navigating away discards them with no prompt. The earlier stale-handler test could not
   * catch it because it uses Start Job, which is the one lifecycle handler that does NOT
   * clear isDirty. (Codex round 4.)

   * DELIBERATELY NOT TESTED HERE: the pre-passive-effect window.
   *
   * React commits a render and only then runs passive effects. If route invalidation

   * would read a `routeIdRef` still naming A, pass isCurrentLoad(), and install A's

   * synchronously inside the commit, so no promise continuation can interleave.
   *
   * That change is NOT covered by a regression test, and the honest reason is that this
   * harness cannot produce the window: `act` flushes passive effects synchronously, so
   * inside `act` the invalidation has always already run by the time any awaited promise
   * resumes. An attempt to force the ordering — releasing the held response from a
   * sibling's layout effect during B's own commit, so it resolves as a microtask — was
   * built and measured, and it passed identically with the layout effect and with a
   * `useEffect` downgraded from it. It could not fail for the reason it named, so it was
   * removed rather than kept as a green check that tests less than its title claims.
   *
   * What IS established: downgrading `useLayoutEffect` to `useEffect` reddens nothing in
   * this file. Treat the layout effect as reasoned-and-strictly-earlier, not as proven.

   * save_job writes a DUPLICATE job that can be completed, invoiced, or move inventory.
