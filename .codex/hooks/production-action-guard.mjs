// Sol HIGH finding (2026-08-14, write-scope review): with the Supabase connector
// write-enabled, ANY mutating Supabase tool Codex can reach is a route to
// production schema/data changes that bypasses the migration gates. Supabase
// tools are therefore governed by an EXACT read-only allowlist — a tool this
// guard has never heard of fails closed instead of failing open. execute_sql is
// the one deliberate exception: it passes through to the content gate below,
// which only admits clearly read-only SQL.
// CodeRabbit follow-up: the app connector's MCP prefix is a UUID, not the
// literal `supabase` server name, so the allowlist matches that known UUID
// too. If the connector is ever re-created under a new UUID, its known
// leaves stay covered by the suffix blocklist and the execute_sql content
// gate below; add the new UUID here so unknown leaves fail closed again.
// Codex-review follow-up: the built-in codex_apps/supabase channel (the one
// actually serving Codex traffic per docs/manual/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) normalizes
// to app-style names with a SINGLE underscore (mcp__codex_apps__supabase_<leaf>),
// so `_{1,2}` accepts both naming forms — same dual-form handling as
