# Create Migration

Generate a new Supabase migration file, update TypeScript types, and keep docs in sync — all from a plain-English description.

## Step 1: Understand What's Needed

Ask the user to describe the database change in plain English. Clarify:
- What tables/columns/functions are being added or changed?
- Are there RLS policies needed?
- Are there indexes needed for performance?

If the user already described the change before invoking this skill, skip the question and proceed.

## Step 2: Generate the Migration File

1. Get the current timestamp for the filename:

```bash
date -u +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
```

2. Create the file at `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<short_snake_case_description>.sql`
   - Keep the description part under 50 characters
   - Use snake_case (e.g., `add_tote_tracking`, `create_invoice_table`)

3. Write the SQL with these conventions (match existing migrations):
   - Always include a comment header explaining the purpose
   - Use `public` schema explicitly
   - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` to make a migration safely re-runnable — but **not
     reflexively**. A blanket guard silently swallows schema drift: if an object already exists
     in a shape you did not expect, `IF NOT EXISTS` leaves the wrong object in place and records
     the migration as successful. Before adding a guard, check the live catalog read-only
     (Supabase MCP) for that object. If it already exists, resolve the drift deliberately instead
     of guarding past it.
   - For new tables: include `id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY`,
     `created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()`, `updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()`
   - For new tables: **always add the `updated_at` trigger in the same migration** —
     `docs/workflows/DATABASE_CHANGE_CHECKLIST.md` lists omitting it as a known repeat mistake,
     and the column alone never updates itself. Use the house trigger function (not the
     `moddatetime` extension — it is not the project pattern):

     ```sql
     CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at
       BEFORE UPDATE ON public.my_new_table
       FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at();
     ```

   - For new tables: always add `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` **and** real policies
     in the same migration. `USING (true)` is a placeholder, not a policy — role-gate it.
   - For new columns: use `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
   - For new functions: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` is the statement form, **not** the security
     contract. Any function this migration creates must also satisfy the CRX Hard Rules in
     `AGENTS.md`:
     - `SECURITY DEFINER` functions set `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` and get **deliberate,
       narrow** grants — `REVOKE EXECUTE FROM PUBLIC, anon`, then `GRANT` only to the roles that
       genuinely need it. (An empty search path is allowed only as the narrow 2026-07-30 exception
       in `docs/manual/DECISION_LOG.md`: a deliberately fully schema-qualified body with
       migration-review proof.)
     - A plain read-only function should normally stay **`SECURITY INVOKER`** so RLS still applies.
       Use `SECURITY DEFINER` only when owner privileges are actually required, and say why in
       the header comment.
     - Mutating RPCs accept and **actually enforce** `p_idempotency_key text DEFAULT NULL`, with
       the lookup scoped to `operation`, not the key alone.
     - Mutating RPCs validate the actor against `auth.uid()` and check role/active-profile; never
       trust a caller-supplied `p_performed_by` without an `ACTOR_MISMATCH` gate.
     - New money storage is `bigint` cents — never float. Existing PostgreSQL numeric-dollar
       storage may remain temporarily to avoid a risky unit rewrite, but it is not an approved or
       suppressible exception until exact `numeric` math is verified, existing values are finite
       whole cents, and an active finite whole-cent CHECK is present. Dirty or unconstrained columns
       remain tracked findings; do not retype, widen, or rewrite their values without owner approval.

   If the change involves an RPC of any complexity, use `/new-rpc` instead: it carries the full
   RPC contract and this skill's template is deliberately minimal.

## Step 3: Update TypeScript Types

Read `src/types/index.ts` and update it to match the schema change:
- New table → add a new `export interface`
- New column → add the field to the existing interface
- Changed column type → update the field type
- New enum/type → add a new `export type`

Follow existing conventions in the file (look at how other interfaces are structured).

## Step 4: Verify

TypeScript typecheck proves the app compiles. It proves **nothing** about the SQL — a migration
can typecheck perfectly and still be invalid, unsafe, or drifted. Run all of these:

```bash
npm run typecheck
bash scripts/validate-sql-migrations.sh
npm run test:drift
```

If there are type errors caused by the new/changed types, fix them:
- Check components that use the affected interface
- Update any destructuring or property access that changed
- Do NOT fix pre-existing type errors unrelated to this migration

For anything touching RLS, `SECURITY DEFINER`, money, or an existing table, the real proof gate
is `/migration-review` (security + drift reviewer subagents, plus a Codex verdict for SQL/RLS/
money) and a rolled-back smoke run (`node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --spec <rpc>` →
`SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK`). Those run before any live apply — do not report the migration as proven
on a typecheck alone.

## Step 5: Update Documentation

### migration-history.md
Read `docs/reference/migration-history.md` and add a new row to the table with:
- Timestamp (from filename)
- Filename
- One-line description of what it does

### database-schema.md (if tables or columns changed)
Read `docs/reference/database-schema.md` and:
- New table → add it under the correct domain section with all columns listed
- New column → add it to the existing table listing
- Changed column → update the listing

### rpc-functions.md (if functions were created)
Read `docs/reference/rpc-functions.md` and add the new function with:
- Function name
- Parameters
- Return type
- One-line description

## Step 6: Print Summary

After everything is done, print:

```
=== Migration Created ===

File: supabase/migrations/<filename>.sql
Type updates: src/types/index.ts
Typecheck:    PASS / FAIL (with details)
SQL validate: PASS / FAIL
Drift test:   PASS / FAIL

Docs updated:
  - docs/reference/migration-history.md
  - docs/reference/database-schema.md  (if applicable)
  - docs/reference/rpc-functions.md    (if applicable)

⚠️  Remember: This migration is LOCAL only.
    Applying it to the live database goes through /migration-review →
    scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs, after the PR's final CodeRabbit and
    Sol reviews are clean (Mason's autonomous-landing rule, 2026-09-26:
    non-destructive = no per-migration ask once the full proof + Sol gate
    passes; destructive, data-overwriting or access-changing = only after Mason's own `approve <code>` chat reply for that exact file (`scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs` builds the request; the apply gate enforces the recorded reply)). NEVER `supabase db push` and
    NEVER the dashboard SQL editor — both bypass the review gate and are blocked.
    After a live apply that changes tables, columns, constraints, or
    status values, refresh the schema registry (/regen-schema-registry).
```

## Important Safety Rules

- NEVER modify an existing migration file — only create new ones
- NEVER apply the migration automatically from this skill — this skill only writes the file. Applying goes through `/migration-review` + migration-apply-guard under Mason's autonomous-landing rule (2026-09-26): non-destructive = full proof + Sol gate, no per-migration ask, after the PR's final reviews are clean; destructive, data-overwriting or access-changing = only after Mason's own `approve <code>` chat reply for that exact file (`scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs` builds the request; the apply gate enforces the recorded reply). Never send or relay that reply yourself; only Mason's own message counts.
- NEVER commit automatically — the user decides when to commit
- NEVER report a migration verified on `npm run typecheck` alone — typecheck does not read SQL
- NEVER create a new table without RLS, real policies, and the `updated_at` trigger in the same file
- NEVER make a read-only function `SECURITY DEFINER` by default; that silently bypasses RLS
- If the SQL could be destructive (DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN), warn the user clearly before writing the file
