# Create New RPC Function

Create a properly structured Supabase RPC (stored procedure) with all the safety patterns CRX Manager requires.

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user (skip if already described):
- **Function name** — What should it be called? (e.g., `create_tote`, `update_delivery_status`)
- **Purpose** — What does it do in one sentence?
- **Parameters** — What inputs does it need?
- **Returns** — What should it return? (uuid, json, void, table?)
- **Mutates data?** — Does it INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE?

## Step 2: Pre-Flight Checks (CRITICAL)

Before writing ANY SQL, run these checks — read-only via Supabase MCP `execute_sql`
(project `rhyzpcqhnizqbxphqdkr`), one statement per call (the MCP returns only the
last statement's result):

### Check for existing function with same name
```sql
SELECT proname, pg_get_function_identity_arguments(oid)
FROM pg_proc
WHERE pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
  AND proname = 'function_name_here';
```
Schema-qualify it. Without `pronamespace`, this also matches functions in `pg_catalog`,
`extensions`, and every other schema, so a common name comes back with false hits.
If results come back, there's already a function with this name. Either pick a different name or confirm we're replacing it (and that the parameter signature matches).

### Check for overloads
```sql
SELECT proname, count(*)
FROM pg_proc
WHERE pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
  AND proname = 'function_name_here'
GROUP BY proname
HAVING count(*) > 1;
```
Must return ZERO rows. If it returns anything, we have dangerous overloads to clean up first.

### If the function reads/writes a table, verify the table's columns
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'table_name_here'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```
Never assume column names from memory — always verify.

## Step 3: Generate the Migration

Get timestamp and create the file:

```bash
date -u +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
```

File: `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_create_<function_name>.sql`

### SQL Template (for mutating functions)

```sql
-- Create <function_name>: <one-line description>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.<function_name>(
  p_param1 uuid,
  p_param2 text,
  p_idempotency_key text DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS uuid
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public, pg_temp
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_id uuid;
  v_existing jsonb;
BEGIN
  -- Idempotency check — the lookup MUST be scoped to THIS function's operation
  -- name. An unscoped key-only lookup returns ANY operation's cached row on a
  -- key collision (the restore_quote_version bug class; 22 live RPCs had to be
  -- swept). idempotency-body-check.mjs hard-denies the unscoped shape.
  IF p_idempotency_key IS NOT NULL THEN
    SELECT result INTO v_existing
      FROM idempotency_keys
      WHERE idempotency_key = p_idempotency_key
        AND operation = '<function_name>';  -- ALWAYS scope to this function's name
    IF v_existing IS NOT NULL THEN
      RETURN (v_existing->>'id')::uuid;
    END IF;
  END IF;

  -- === Main logic here ===

  INSERT INTO some_table (col1, col2)
  VALUES (p_param1, p_param2)
  RETURNING id INTO v_id;

  -- === End main logic ===

  -- Record idempotency
  IF p_idempotency_key IS NOT NULL THEN
    INSERT INTO idempotency_keys (idempotency_key, operation, result)
    VALUES (p_idempotency_key, '<function_name>', jsonb_build_object('id', v_id));
  END IF;

  RETURN v_id;
END;
$$;

-- Deliberate grants — REQUIRED on every SECURITY DEFINER function. Without
-- these, anon/PUBLIC can execute it (incident classes B7-B9). Note: REVOKE
-- FROM PUBLIC alone does NOT de-anon — revoke anon explicitly.
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION public.<function_name>(uuid, text, text) FROM PUBLIC, anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.<function_name>(uuid, text, text) TO authenticated;
```

### SQL Template (for read-only functions)

**Default to `SECURITY INVOKER` for reads.** An invoker-rights function runs as the caller, so
RLS still applies and the caller sees exactly the rows they are already allowed to see. Marking
a read `SECURITY DEFINER` makes it run as the owner and **bypasses RLS** — that is how a report
function ends up returning another customer's rows. Postgres defaults to invoker, so the plain
template below is already correct; write `SECURITY INVOKER` explicitly to make the choice visible.

```sql
-- <function_name>: <one-line description>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.<function_name>(
  p_param1 uuid
)
RETURNS TABLE (col1 uuid, col2 text, col3 numeric)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY INVOKER
SET search_path = public, pg_temp
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT t.col1, t.col2, t.col3
  FROM some_table t
  WHERE t.id = p_param1;
END;
$$;

-- Deliberate grants — required on every RPC, invoker or definer
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION public.<function_name>(uuid) FROM PUBLIC, anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.<function_name>(uuid) TO authenticated;
```

Use `SECURITY DEFINER` on a read **only** when owner privileges are genuinely required (it must
read something the caller's RLS legitimately hides — e.g. a cross-tenant aggregate an admin is
entitled to). When you do:

- keep `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`,
- enforce the authorization yourself inside the body (role check against `auth.uid()` and an
  active profile — RLS is no longer doing it for you),
- say in the header comment why definer rights are necessary.

That combination is exactly what `rls-security-reviewer` looks for.

### CRITICAL Patterns (DO NOT deviate)

- `SECURITY DEFINER` + `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` — ALWAYS together
- Choose the security mode deliberately: reads default to `SECURITY INVOKER` so RLS still applies;
  `SECURITY DEFINER` bypasses RLS and therefore must enforce role/active-profile checks in its body
- `p_idempotency_key text DEFAULT NULL` — REQUIRED on all mutating functions
- idempotency lookup MUST include `AND operation = '<function_name>'` — an unscoped lookup is hard-denied by the idempotency hook
- idempotency_keys columns: `idempotency_key`, `operation`, `result` — NEVER `key`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`
- `result` column is `jsonb` — NEVER cast to `::text`
- Deliberate grants on EVERY function: `REVOKE ALL ... FROM PUBLIC, anon;` + `GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated;` — REVOKE FROM PUBLIC alone does NOT de-anon
- Money values: new storage uses `bigint` cents, never `numeric` dollars or `float`. Existing
  PostgreSQL numeric-dollar storage may remain temporarily to avoid a risky unit rewrite, but it is
  not an approved or suppressible exception until exact `numeric` math is verified, existing values
  are finite whole cents, and an active finite whole-cent CHECK is present. Dirty or unconstrained
  columns remain tracked findings; do not retype, widen, or rewrite their values in an RPC change.

## Step 4: Update TypeScript Types

If the function returns a new shape, add or update the interface in `src/types/index.ts`.

## Step 5: Update Documentation

### rpc-functions.md
Read `docs/reference/rpc-functions.md` and add:

| Function | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| function_name | p_param1 uuid, p_param2 text, p_idempotency_key text | uuid | One-line description |

### migration-history.md
Add new row to `docs/reference/migration-history.md`.

(Do NOT add function/migration counts to `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — volatile counts
live only in `docs/reference/` files that `npm run check:docs` validates.)

## Step 6: Verify

Typecheck and build prove the TypeScript side compiles. They read **no SQL at all** — a broken,
unsafe, or drifted function passes both. Run the SQL-aware gates too:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run build
bash scripts/validate-sql-migrations.sh
npm run test:drift
```

Then get real proof of the function itself:

- Dispatch `rls-security-reviewer` and `migration-drift-reviewer` (this is a
  `SECURITY DEFINER` / RLS / money path — that is what `/migration-review` runs).
- Run the rollback-only smoke for the new RPC —
  `node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --spec <function_name>` — and require `SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK`.
  It exercises the function inside a transaction that is rolled back, so it proves the SQL
  actually executes without touching live data.
- For money or inventory functions, check the invariant in the smoke output, not by reading
  the SQL.

Do not report the RPC as verified on typecheck + build alone.

## Step 7: Print Summary

```
=== RPC Function Created ===

Function:  public.<function_name>
Migration: supabase/migrations/<filename>.sql
Mutating:  YES/NO
Idempotent: YES/NO

Pre-flight checks:
  - No existing function: PASS
  - No overloads: PASS
  - Column names verified: PASS

Docs updated:
  - docs/reference/rpc-functions.md
  - docs/reference/migration-history.md

Typecheck:    PASS
Build:        PASS
SQL validate: PASS
Drift test:   PASS
Reviewers:    rls-security-reviewer / migration-drift-reviewer verdicts
Smoke:        SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK (or: not run — say so)

⚠️  Remember: This migration is LOCAL only. Applying it to the live database goes
    through `/migration-review` → `scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs` after the PR's
    final CodeRabbit and Sol reviews are clean (Mason's 2026-09-26 landing rule:
    non-destructive = full proof + Sol gate, no ask; destructive, data-overwriting or access-changing = only after Mason's own `approve <code>` chat reply for that exact file (`scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs` builds the request; the apply gate enforces the recorded reply)). NEVER `supabase db push` and
    NEVER the dashboard SQL editor — both bypass the review gate and are blocked.
```

## Safety Rules

- NEVER skip the pre-flight checks — overloads caused multiple production bugs
- NEVER use `key`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, or `result_id` for idempotency_keys columns
- NEVER cast idempotency result to `::text` — it's jsonb
- NEVER skip `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` on SECURITY DEFINER functions
- NEVER create a function without checking for overloads first
- NEVER make a read-only function `SECURITY DEFINER` by default — that silently bypasses RLS
- NEVER report an RPC verified on `npm run typecheck && npm run build` alone; neither reads SQL
