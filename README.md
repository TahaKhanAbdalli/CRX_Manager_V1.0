# CRX Manager V1.0

Business management system for **Crop RX Solutions**, an agricultural chemical distributor. Manages the full order-to-cash workflow: customer management, 3-tier product pricing, quote building, order fulfillment, delivery scheduling with GPS & digital signatures, inventory tracking, purchase orders, blend ticket OCR, invoicing, payments, AR aging, commission tracking, field mapping, compliance, and reporting.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Maps:** Mapbox GL JS + react-map-gl (satellite field mapping with draw tools)
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Deployment:** Vercel → [croprxsolutions.app](https://croprxsolutions.app)
- **Other:** jsPDF (PDF generation), Google Vision AI (OCR), proj4/shpjs/@tmcw/togeojson (GIS import), Sentry (error tracking), Lucide React (icons)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 24 (the version pinned in `.nvmrc`; CI uses the same file)
- Supabase project with migrations applied
- Mapbox account (free tier) for satellite field maps
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masonwells1/CRX_Manager_V1.0.git
cd CRX_Manager_V1.0
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase URL, anon key, and Mapbox token
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anonymous/public key |
| `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Mapbox public access token (for field maps) |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSN for error tracking (optional) |

All variables must start with `VITE_` to be accessible in the app. See `.env.example`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server (port 5173) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm test` | Run the full unit-test suite |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run unit tests in watch mode |
| `npm run typecheck` | Check TypeScript errors |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright E2E tests |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Interactive Playwright test UI |

> **Note:** Pre-commit runs fast checks for the files staged in the commit, plus the repository's safety and workflow-parity guards. Pre-push runs private-artifact containment, TypeScript, and the production build. CI is the full-product-proof gate: it runs lint, type checking, unit coverage, the production build, and the applicable safety checks before merge.

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **admin** | Full access to everything |
| **sales_rep** | Own assigned customers, quotes, orders, products (read-only) |
| **driver** | Own assigned deliveries, customer addresses (read-only) |
| **applicator** | Own assigned jobs, application records, products/fields (read-only) |

The database also allows a fifth role, `entity_recipient`. It is not a login role: it marks the service profiles for business entities that receive commission payments. Those profiles can never sign in and are left out of the Team Board and Settings user lists.

## Database

Counts (tables, functions, migrations, Edge Functions) change with almost every release, so this page does not repeat them. Every database change is a file under `supabase/migrations/`, and each Edge Function is a folder under `supabase/functions/`. For current, dated figures and live state see [docs/manual/CURRENT_STATE.md](./docs/manual/CURRENT_STATE.md) and the [migration history](./docs/reference/migration-history.md).

See the [database schema reference](./docs/reference/database-schema.md) for the table and RLS policy inventory, and the [RPC reference](./docs/reference/rpc-functions.md) for database functions.

## Deployment

Deployed to **Vercel** at [croprxsolutions.app](https://croprxsolutions.app). Configuration in `vercel.json` with security headers.

`main` is protected: nobody pushes to it directly. A change lands through a branch, a pull request, the required CI checks, and review; merging that pull request into `main` is what deploys the live site, and Vercel keeps one-click rollback to an earlier deployment.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment instructions, environment setup, and rollback procedures.

## Documentation

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) | Short shared contract and task-routing entry point for coding agents |
| [Agent onboarding](./docs/manual/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md) | First-session reading order, recurring failure modes, and verification expectations |
| [Architecture](./docs/manual/ARCHITECTURE.md) | System architecture, data flow, business logic, and code-location map |
| [Reference docs](./docs/reference/) | Current schema, RPC, route, pattern, and guardrail references |
| [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) | Testing guide (beginner-friendly) — setup, running tests, troubleshooting |
| [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) | Deployment instructions — Vercel setup, env vars, rollback |

## Current State

- Every page inside the app is lazy-loaded (the login and password pages load eagerly); the page and route list is in [docs/reference/pages-routes.md](./docs/reference/pages-routes.md)
- Unit tests (Vitest) live next to the code in `src/`; the main Playwright E2E suite (`tests/e2e/`) needs a staging Supabase project that does not exist yet (see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)); the self-contained Playwright proofs in `tests/row-version-ui/` and `tests/phase1a-ui/` run locally
- When a pull request is routed to full CI (any change beyond docs), CI blocks a merge on any ESLint warning, TypeScript error, failing unit test, or failed build
- Git hooks: pre-commit runs fast checks on staged files; pre-push runs TypeScript and the production build (see the note under Commands)
- **Deployed to Vercel** at [croprxsolutions.app](https://croprxsolutions.app) (live)
- Current status, open problems, and dated counts: [docs/manual/CURRENT_STATE.md](./docs/manual/CURRENT_STATE.md) and [docs/manual/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./docs/manual/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
