-- STATUS: NOT APPLIED.
-- Record completed deliveries that were billed OUTSIDE CRX (e.g. in Chem Man, before CRX
-- invoicing was in use), so the books and the integrity checks stop treating them as unbilled.
--
-- Why: spring 2026 deliveries were completed in CRX but invoiced in Chem Man, CRX's predecessor. CRX still sees
-- them as "completed with no invoice", so:
--   * the monthly integrity report's Delivery-Invoice Quantity check (src/lib/reconciliation.ts,
--     checkDeliveryInvoiceQuantityParity) fails on every one of them, and
--   * the admin Integrity Cleanup page offers "Create draft invoice" on each, which would bill a
--     customer a second time for goods already billed elsewhere.
-- Creating CRX invoices for them would invent revenue and receivables that do not exist in CRX's
-- books, so instead this records the fact explicitly.
--
-- What this file does (schema and one read-only dashboard function; it marks NO deliveries — that is a separate, owner-approved
-- data migration):
--   1. delivery_external_billings: one row per delivery billed outside CRX, with a reason.
--      Read-only, for admins and sales reps (the Office Cockpit tile they share), through RLS. No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grant to any API role, so a row can
--      only be written by a reviewed migration (postgres).
--   2. guard_delivery_external_billing (BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE on the new table): a delivery can be
--      recorded only if it is a completed, non-deleted order delivery that NO active CRX invoice
--      covers (same coverage rule as src/lib/deliveryInvoiceCoverage.ts and the Integrity Cleanup
--      page: a non-credit, non-deleted, non-voided/cancelled invoice on the order whose
--      delivery_id is this delivery or NULL). The delivery row and then its order row are locked
--      first — the order every invoice writer and void_delivery use — so a concurrent invoice or
--      void cannot slip in between the check and the commit.
--   3. guard_invoice_delivery_billed_outside_crx (BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE OF delivery_id, order_id,
--      invoice_type, deleted_at, status on invoices; re-checked whenever an invoice is created, changes
--      what it bills, or becomes active again after a soft-delete or void), refusing with
--      DELIVERY_BILLED_OUTSIDE_CRX:
--        * an invoice for a delivery recorded here (create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery,
--          complete_delivery's per-delivery invoice, the Delivery page's create-invoice action);
--        * a WHOLE-ORDER invoice (delivery_id NULL) on an order with any recorded delivery —
--          save_invoice and the split-by-field engine both bill a fully delivered order without
--          naming a delivery, which would bill the recorded deliveries again
--          (create_invoice_from_order already refuses any order with an active delivery). On an
--          ordinary order the remaining deliveries are still invoiced per delivery. On a
--          split-billed order (field allocations) the split engine is the only CRX billing path,
--          so recording any of its deliveries leaves the rest unbillable in CRX until the record
--          is removed — record such an order only if ALL of its billing happened outside CRX.
--          complete_delivery's automatic split attempt falls back to "needs split billing"
--          when refused, so completing a delivery is never blocked. (Checked 2026-10-07: none of
--          the spring 2026 orders this was built for has field allocations.)
--      Every invoice writer is a postgres-owned SECURITY DEFINER function, so a table trigger
--      binds all of them. Credit memos are exempt: they credit, never bill. The trigger is named
--      zz_ so it fires after trg_guard_invoice_terminal_order, which locks the order on INSERT: by
--      then a recording committed by guard 2 (which holds the same lock) is visible. (That trigger
--      also refuses any UPDATE of order_id/delivery_id, so the UPDATEs this guard acts on are an
--      invoice_type change and an invoice becoming active again — a restore from soft-delete, which
--      no app path does, or an un-void, which needs the admin override. For those the guard takes
--      the order lock itself before checking, so a concurrent recording is always seen.)
--      A recorded delivery that is later voided still blocks whole-order billing of its
--      order — fail-closed; remove the record by migration if that is ever wanted.
--   3b. refuse_billed_outside_delivery_reparent (BEFORE UPDATE OF order_id on deliveries): a
--      recorded delivery can never be moved to another order or detached from its order
--      (BILLED_OUTSIDE_DELIVERY_ORDER_LOCKED). Guard 3 finds recorded deliveries through their
--      CURRENT order, so a move would let a whole-order invoice on the original order bill those
--      goods again (Sol exact-SHA review, 2026-10-09). The delivery row is already locked by the
--      UPDATE, so a recording committed meanwhile is seen.
--   4. get_dashboard_action_items: the dashboard's "Delivered, not invoiced" list skips recorded
--      deliveries (live body re-emitted with one added predicate; preflight-pinned).
--
-- No existing row changes. No money moves. Reversible by a new reviewed migration (never by
-- editing this file), in this order, only after removing the dependent frontend reads:
--   0. Re-emit get_dashboard_action_items from 20260827041300_align_return_credit_delivery_surfaces.sql
