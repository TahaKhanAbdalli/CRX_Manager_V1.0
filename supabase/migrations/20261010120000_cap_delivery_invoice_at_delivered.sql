-- STATUS: NOT APPLIED.
-- A delivery invoice can bill only what its delivery delivered.
--
-- Why (Sol exact-SHA review of PR #889, 2026-10-10, HIGH): an invoice created for one delivery
-- (invoices.delivery_id set, by create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery, complete_delivery's per-delivery
-- invoice or create_quick_delivery) stays editable while it is a draft or unposted. save_invoice
-- rebuilds its lines (_save_invoice_lineage_unaware_impl_20260827 deletes and re-inserts them; its
-- only quantity check is > 0), and _save_invoice_scoped_impl locks the product, unit and order line of
-- an order-linked line but not its quantity, and accepts new lines with no order link. So an admin,
-- or a sales rep on their own customer, could raise a quantity or add another product, billing goods
-- this delivery never carried — goods that may already be billed on another delivery's invoice or
-- billed outside CRX (delivery_external_billings). Posting did not re-check either.
--
-- What this file does (schema only; no row changes; no money moves):
--   1. _delivery_invoice_overbilling(invoice_id) returns NULL when the invoice is within its delivery,
--      or the reason it is not. It applies only to an ACTIVE delivery invoice: delivery_id set, not a
--      credit memo, not soft-deleted, not voided/cancelled. Rules:
--        * a posted (posted/paid/overdue) delivery invoice needs a completed delivery: an invoice billed
--          up front (create_quick_delivery) stays a draft until the delivery is done, because
--          complete_delivery cuts only DRAFT invoices down to what was delivered;
--        * every line names a product (a delivery invoice bills delivered goods, nothing else;
--          checked live 2026-10-10: no invoice line anywhere lacks a product, and the invoice editor
--          only adds product lines) and has a quantity of zero or more;
--        * a line linked to an order line must be for an order line this delivery carried, with the
--          same product (any quantity, zero included: the link is billing lineage);
--        * per order line, and per product, the quantity billed across ALL active invoices for this
--          delivery is at most what the delivery allows: quantity_delivered once the delivery is
--          completed; the scheduled quantity (GREATEST of quantity and quantity_delivered) while it
--          is still scheduled or in progress — create_quick_delivery bills the planned amount up
--          front; zero once the delivery is cancelled, voided or deleted (cancel_delivery cancels its
--          draft and unposted invoices, void_delivery its drafts; an unposted invoice left on a voided
--          delivery can then no longer be posted — it fails closed).
--      Quantities are compared in the delivery's own units: every writer copies the delivery line's
--      quantity into the invoice line unchanged, and the unit label is not part of the match (live
--      labels vary in spelling only, e.g. "Gal"/"Gallon"). Each delivery line's allowance is rounded to
--      4 decimals, the scale of invoice_items.quantity, so a copied quantity never rounds past it
--      (delivery quantities are unscaled numeric; live has none past 4 decimals, checked 2026-10-10).
--      Rounding each line, not the total, can allow at most 0.00005 of a unit per delivery line more
--      than a sub-4-decimal recording — accepted; the other way would refuse a faithful copy.
--   2. enforce_delivery_invoice_within_delivered: the trigger function that raises
--      DELIVERY_INVOICE_EXCEEDS_DELIVERED with that reason. Before checking a write that can add
--      billing it takes the ORDER row lock that every invoice-line writer already holds, so two
--      transactions adding billing to the same delivery (even on two different invoices) check one
--      after the other and the second sees the first's committed lines — with no new lock order.
--   3. Two ordinary AFTER ... FOR EACH ROW triggers, checked at the end of the writing statement
--      (NOT deferred to commit, so a caller's EXCEPTION block — batch_post_invoices' per-invoice
--      failure list, process_offline_action's office review queue — still catches a refusal):
--        * zz_cap_delivery_invoice_items: AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF invoice_id, product_id,
--          order_item_id, quantity ON invoice_items. Removing a line never adds billing, so DELETE is
--          not watched; other column updates (complete_delivery's tote_number copy) are not watched.
--          Two UPDATEs are always let through, so nobody is blocked from fixing or finishing work:
--          lowering a line's quantity, and — on a DRAFT only — setting an order-linked line to
--          exactly what its completed delivery delivered on that order line (complete_delivery's
--          partial-delivery trim — a driver finishing a short delivery is never refused). The draft
--          can then still be over its delivery because of OTHER lines; posting refuses it until fixed.
--          save_invoice's rebuild (delete every line, re-insert, then restore order links in one
--          UPDATE) is checked after each statement; none of those states bills more than the final
--          one, so the result is the same as a check at commit.
--        * zz_cap_delivery_invoice_header: AFTER UPDATE OF delivery_id, invoice_type, deleted_at,
--          status ON invoices, only when the invoice becomes something that bills this delivery
--          again: a new delivery or type, a restore from soft-delete, an un-void, or POSTING
--          (draft/unposted -> posted/paid/overdue, including an admin-override jump). Paid/overdue
--          marking of a posted invoice and voiding are never re-checked, so existing posted invoices
--          keep working.
--   4. refuse_overlapping_order_and_delivery_invoices (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF delivery_id, order_id,
--      invoice_type, deleted_at, status ON invoices, zz_refuse_overlapping_order_delivery_invoices):
--      an order is billed EITHER per delivery OR by whole-order invoices, never both — the cap above
--      cannot see an order-level invoice (delivery_id NULL), so an order-level invoice made after a
--      delivery invoice (save_invoice can create one) would bill the same goods twice. Refuses, with
--      ORDER_INVOICE_OVERLAPS_DELIVERY_INVOICE, an active non-credit invoice of one kind while the
--      order has an active non-credit invoice of the other kind; checked when an invoice is created,
--      or becomes active or billing again, under the order lock every invoice writer already takes
--      (so two concurrent creations of opposite kinds cannot both pass). Every delivery-invoice
--      writer already refused the other direction; split billing (create_split_invoices_from_order)
--      bills only orders with field allocations, which never get delivery invoices. Checked live
--      2026-10-10: no order-level invoices exist at all.
--   The preflight locks invoices and invoice_items, then refuses to install if any active delivery
--   invoice already breaks a rule (checked live 2026-10-10: 12 active delivery invoices on 12
--   completed deliveries, none over).
--
-- Behavior changes, accepted:
--   * A delivery recorded short cannot be billed for more on its own invoice; the delivery record is
--     what the cap trusts.
--   * If a scheduled delivery loses a product after its up-front invoice was drafted (edit_delivery),
--     the draft keeps a line for an order line the delivery no longer carries. Completing the
--     delivery still works; posting that draft is refused, and since save_invoice will not drop an
--     order-linked line, the office voids it and re-creates the invoice from the delivery.
--   * consolidate_draft_invoices would also be refused here (it moves one delivery's lines onto
--     another delivery's invoice), but INVOICE_ITEM_LINEAGE_IMMUTABLE already refuses every line move
--     (20260721014858), so nothing changes for it.
-- Not covered here (unchanged behavior): the quantities on an order-level invoice (one can no longer
-- share an order with delivery invoices, item 4); unit prices, and the unit label of a manually added line; two delivery_items rows
-- for one order line on one delivery (none live, 2026-10-10; complete_delivery's trim would then be
-- checked in full rather than exempted); and a delivery whose items are changed after its invoice was posted (a posted delivery invoice now needs
-- a completed delivery, and enforce_delivery_items_parent_lock already freezes a completed delivery's
-- items) — the monthly integrity report's delivery-invoice quantity check flags any that exists.
-- The cap relies on trg_guard_invoice_terminal_order (20260721014858): a delivery invoice keeps
-- exactly its delivery's order, and neither delivery_id nor order_id can change after creation, so
-- an invoice cannot be detached from its delivery to dodge this check.
