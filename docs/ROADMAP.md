# CRX Manager — Roadmap

> **Last updated:** 2026-07-16 (portal-doc pointer corrected 2026-09-26; current-direction pointer updated 2026-10-14) | **Owner:** Mason Wells
>
> ⭐ **Current direction lives in `docs/plans/2026-10-13-direction-and-goals.md`** (October 2026; it replaces the priority order in `docs/roadmap/2026-07-15-roadmap-and-execution-plan.md`, whose north star and ticket board still stand), and the combined open-items list lives in root `TODO.md`. Where an item below disagrees with the direction doc, the direction doc is newer. This file remains the item-by-item historical backlog (strategic IDs A1–F3, portal G1–G15, March priorities); its done/TODO statuses were spot-verified against code on 2026-07-16.
>
> _Q1 brainstorm docs were moved to `docs/archive/2026-Q1-brainstorms/` and the links below repointed (2026-05-31). Feature statuses for Priorities 1–6 reflect the March planning cycle; for current system state see `docs/manual/CURRENT_STATE.md`._

## Shipped since last update (2026-06-15 → 2026-07-13)

A large amount landed in this window — see `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for full detail on each. Two categories:

**Items that were open rows on this roadmap and have since shipped** (moved out of their tables below, left a pointer in place):
- **C3** — As-applied vs. billed reconciliation report ("bill every acre you applied") — ✅ **Shipped 2026-06-21** as the Field Invoices "Unbilled Applications" reconciliation view (`/field-invoices/unbilled`), part of the As-Applied / Field Invoices feature merge.

**Major work that shipped in this window but was never an itemized row on this roadmap** (built off later strategic reviews / owner requests, not this document — listed here only so this file doesn't read as if nothing happened; don't expect a 1:1 row match above):
- Sell-side quote-lifecycle roadmap items #2–#7 (booking draw-downs, partial-order conversion, and related quote/order flow work) — shipped live 2026-06-21.
- Field mapping + per-acre billing: two-acre model, shapefile/KML/GeoJSON import, and the USDA Crop Sequence Boundary "click-to-adopt" tool — shipped 2026-06-23 through 2026-07-12.
- ChemMan-parity feature set (map pages, print options, loader worksheets, dispatch/field-editor polish) — 10+ units shipped 2026-07-11/12.
- Mobile overhaul + UI overhaul (bottom nav, phone-card layouts, Office Cockpit consolidation) — shipped 2026-07-11.
- Credit-memo apply (apply a credit memo to an open invoice) — shipped 2026-07-10.
- EPA label lookup Stage 1 (per-product "Look up EPA" + data-quality report) and the in-app Label Data Quality bulk-fix tool — shipped 2026-07-10.
- Inventory-aware scheduling Layer 2 (job reservations draw against bookings) — shipped 2026-07-02.
- Weekly in-database backup (pg_cron) and the off-site encrypted GitHub backup — shipped 2026-07-12/13.
- Workflow-waves (U14–U20) daily-flow/billing/booking/nav fixes and the Today/Office Cockpit dashboard consolidation — shipped 2026-07-09 through 2026-07-11.

## ⭐ Strategic Roadmap (2026-06-10 world-class deep dive)

**Source:** `docs/research/2026-06-10-world-class-deep-dive-report.md` (full scored backlog, market research with citations, architecture prework, and the reasoning behind every item below). Opportunity IDs (A1, B1, C1, …) refer to that report. This section supersedes the March priorities below in strategic direction — the March items remain valid as tactical backlog.

**The 5 moves that matter most:**
1. Let customers pay online (ACH pay-now links → grower portal) — biggest gap vs. every competitor
2. Compliance autopilot (weakest area, 2.5/5 → differentiator using data already captured)
3. Bill from the machine (ISOXML as-applied ingestion — category-defining, unserved for small retailers)
4. Expand AI doc-intelligence to vendor bills + price sheets (proven pattern, <$0.01/doc)
5. Field-level profitability (both data halves already in the schema)

### H1 — This season (≤3 months): cash + compliance quick wins
| ID | Item | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | ACH pay-now links on emailed invoices/statements (Stripe ACH, $5 cap) + webhook Edge Function | M | ⏸ Deferred 2026-06-10 (Mason's call — revisit later). To restart: create a Stripe account (stripe.com, ~15 min) and provide the API keys; this also gates the H2 grower-portal payment features (A2/A4). |
| B1 | RUP point-of-sale certification check (warn/block on expired/missing buyer cert) | S | ✅ Done (2026-06-10 — NewOrder banner + InvoiceDetail post-confirm warning, `feat/h1-quick-wins-2026-06-10`) |
| B5 | License-expiry gates on job assignment + renewal reminders | S | ✅ Done (2026-06-10 — jobs trigger + `assign_job_applicator` RPC + Dashboard card, migrations live) |
| B3 | WPS pre-application info sheet auto-generation | S | ✅ Done (2026-06-10 — `wpsNoticePdf.ts` + JobDetail button + products REI/PHI columns live) |
| ~~B6~~ | ~~State dealer report pack~~ | S | ❌ Closed 2026-06-10 — Mason confirmed IL-only; IL requires records on demand and the /compliance RUP register + CSV export already satisfies it (8 Ill. Adm. Code 250.150, 2-yr retention). Reopen only if licensing expands to WI/other reporting states. |
| E3 | Owner's daily brief (cash, AR movement, today's work, exceptions) | S | ✅ Done (2026-06-10 — DailyBrief admin Dashboard card) |
| D1 | Vendor-bill LLM extraction pilot (gate: 10-bill manual accuracy test) | M | ⏸ Deferred 2026-06-10 (Mason's call — revisit later). To restart: attach ~10 real vendor bills (PDF/photo) for the accuracy gate; production build also needs an Anthropic API key in Edge Function secrets. |
| C4 | Weather auto-capture at application time (replace hand-typed entries) | S | ✅ Done (2026-06-10 — Open-Meteo prefill in Complete Job modal) |
| — | **Cheap tests that gate H2:** collect 3 real ISOXML monitor files (C1); CDMS/Greenbook label-data pricing inquiry (B7); A1 click-through data (gates A2) | — | TODO |

### H2 — This year: the two strategic bets
| ID | Item | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1/P3 | Prework: customer-organization model + server-side PDF generation | M+M | TODO |
| A2 | Grower portal v1 (login, balance, statements, invoice PDFs, pay) | L | TODO |
| A3 | Online quote approval/e-sign in portal (likely industry-first) | M | TODO |
| A4 | Autopay + scheduled payments | M | TODO |
| C1 | ISOXML/ADAPT as-applied file upload → proposed application records (review queue) | L | TODO |
| C3 | As-applied vs. billed reconciliation report ("bill every acre you applied") | S | ✅ Shipped 2026-06-21 — see "Shipped since last update" section above |
| B2 | Dicamba 72-hour record auto-draft | M | TODO |
| B4 | REI/PHI tracking per field + dispatch warnings | M | TODO |
| E4 | Field-level profitability (margin per acre per field/customer/season) | M | TODO |
| D2 | Vendor price-sheet ingestion → proposed cost updates | M | TODO |
| E1 | Driver/applicator mobile workspace (refactor DeliveryDetail into task-first flow) | L | ✅ v1 Done (2026-06-14 — **Field Mode** `/my-route` + `/my-route/:id`, `assign_job_applicator`; PR #80/#81 merged + live). ✅ On-device pass Done (2026-07-11 — mobile overhaul: bottom nav/drawer, compact TopBar, phone-card layouts for Jobs/Dispatch/Inventory/Receiving, full-screen modals, PWA polish). Remaining follow-up: offline replay. |

### H3 — Multi-year: the defensible end-state
| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| C2 | Leaf API integration (John Deere / FieldView / CNH auto-pull) | After C1 proves reconciliation logic |
| B7 | Label-rate validation at blend/order time | Gated on CDMS/Greenbook data licensing |
| E2 | Role-workspace IA redesign (66 flat pages → Sell/Field/Money/Stock) | Only after portal + mobile usage data exists |
| F3 | Multi-tenancy decision point (sell CRX to other retailers?) | Funded decision, not speculative; ~3–4 wk schema retrofit |

### Keep / Change / Kill (current-setup verdicts)
- **KILL:** checks-only payments; no customer-facing surface; compliance-as-passive-register
- **KEEP:** single-tenant (for now); web PWA (no native apps); CRX **is** the ledger (accountant export only, no QuickBooks two-way sync)
- **CHANGE:** OCR-centric intake (machine data above it, manual entry below it); 3 hard-coded price tiers (contract pricing before chasing larger accounts)

### Explicitly NOT building (don't re-add without new evidence)
Native iOS/Android apps · multi-tenancy now · ML demand forecasting (supersedes C7 below) · autonomous AI agents on financial records · QuickBooks two-way sync · grain/energy/feed modules · direct OEM telematics agreements as a first step · big-bang UI redesign.

## Priority 0: Grower Portal & Agronomy Expansion (VISION — iterating, not yet planned)

**The big bet for 2026–27:** expand CRX from internal ops into customer-facing
services — agronomy (soil/tissue testing, nutrition programs), a grower portal,
grower data uploads, and field profitability analytics.

Detailed living vision doc: **`docs/plans/2026-06-10-grower-portal-brainstorm.md`**
(now on `main`; its original PR #74 was closed — this table is the index). Settled so far:
**separate portal app, same Supabase DB**, walled off by RLS + customer-scoped
`portal_*` RPCs and a new `customer` role. Nothing below is scheduled yet — when
the vision settles, each item gets its own `/ship`-grade implementation plan.

**Design/grounding docs (2026-06-14, verified live):**
[`spray-compliance-data-model.md`](plans/2026-06-14-spray-compliance-data-model.md) (G1–G3 first-build data model) ·
[`portal-roadmap-build-vs-reuse-audit.md`](plans/2026-06-14-portal-roadmap-build-vs-reuse-audit.md) (what's already built vs greenfield across G4–G15 — PostGIS/pg_cron already on, but `orders`/`invoices` lack `field_id` and the `customer` role + `portal_*` RPCs are all greenfield).

| # | Feature | Where | Status |
|---|---------|-------|--------|
| G1 | ⭐ **Chemical tracking & spray compliance** — chemical-shed inventory auto-fed from CRX deliveries, per-field spray checklist (sprayed/not + dates), compliance-grade RUP application log (auto-filled EPA reg #s, append-only), exports | Portal + CRX | VISION (Mason priority — candidate first portal feature) |
| G2 | ⭐ **Follow-up trip timers** — pass logged → residual clock starts (e.g. pre-emerge + 26 days → "2nd trip due"); REI/PHI timers; 14-day records-due nudge; doubles as CRX delivery/crew workload forecast | Portal + CRX | VISION (Mason priority) |
| G3 | ⭐ **Internal crew spray board** — same spray-plan data model for custom acres; passes assigned grower vs CRX crew; likely `spray_passes ↔ jobs`/DispatchBoard link; job completion writes compliance record → flows to invoicing | CRX Manager | VISION (Mason priority) |
| G4 | Field seasons (planting/harvest records, manual tier) + whole-field **breakeven calculator** | CRX first, then portal | VISION |
| G5 | Field season costs w/ auto-suggested lines from the grower's own CRX invoices/applications | CRX + portal | VISION |
| G6 | Soil testing program (grid/zone sampling, results maps, resample tracker) | CRX Manager | VISION |
| G7 | Tissue sampling program (growth-stage schedule, season trend charts) | CRX Manager | VISION |
| G8 | Nutrition / dry-fertilizer program builder → one-click CRX quote; grower e-accepts in portal | CRX + portal | VISION |
| G9 | Grower portal MVP — auth (`customer_users`, `customer` role), read-only: programs, test results, documents, statements | New portal repo | VISION |
| G10 | Spatial yield upload (monitor shapefiles/CSV → cleaned → grid-binned cells) | Portal + Edge Fn | VISION |
| G11 | **Profitability map** — per-cell profit/ac (yield × price − costs), red/green over satellite on the existing Mapbox stack; "worst 10% of acres cost you $X" | Portal + CRX | VISION |
| G12 | Grower financial tools — what-if price sliders, per-field P&L, rented-ground analyzer | Portal | VISION |
| G13 | Notifications (email exists; SMS provider TBD) | Edge Fn | VISION |
| G14 | LLM assistant — Claude API via Edge Function, strictly customer-scoped context | Portal | VISION |
| G15 | Nutrient-removal engine — yield map × removal rates → replacement-fert rec / program input | CRX Manager | VISION |

Parked (revisit later): VR prescription writing, multi-year yield stability maps,
NDVI/satellite layers, PostGIS analytics, grain marketing, cross-grower benchmarking.
