# Pages & Routes Reference (80 pages, 95 routes)

> Rebuilt 2026-09-26 from the `src/App.tsx` router. The page count is the number of `lazy(` imports in `src/App.tsx` (it includes the `JobDetailRoute` wrapper and the dev-only `DesignPreview`). The route count is the number of rows in this table, which lists every router path except `login`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, and the `*` catch-all. `npm run check:docs` (`scripts/check-doc-drift.mjs`) compares the page count with `src/App.tsx`, but compares the route count only with this table's own rows: nothing checks that each row matches a real route, so rebuild the table from `src/App.tsx` whenever routes change. Redirect rows are routes kept for old bookmarks and render no page of their own. Role gates come from `ProtectedRoute allowedRoles` in `src/App.tsx` and the page registry in `src/lib/pagePermissions.ts`.
