# Governed non-interference queue ledger — July 25, 2026

## Objective and boundary

This ledger records the governed queue without changing the application, a
database, a live deployment, or another lane's work. Its purpose is to make
the completed review/implementation work, its exact evidence, and its still
separate approval gates unambiguous.

This branch's cumulative diff owns one substantive file,
`docs/audits/2026-07-25-governed-noninterference-queue-ledger.md`, plus the
mandatory `docs/app-workflow-map.html` Jul 23-to-25 date-only hook churn. It
does **not** modify the dirty gauntlet index or summary, Supplier/Product files,
shared types or generated artifacts, Phase 3 plans, `.husky/pre-commit`, manual
documentation, migration history, or the smoke registry. No migration, live
query, live write, deployment, push, or production action was performed for
this ledger.

## Orchestration provenance

- **Primary reviewer:** Sol-high performed the primary adversarial work.
- **Writers:** Terra writers were deliberately bounded to their assigned,
  non-overlapping lanes.
- **Not represented:** Luna was unavailable. This ledger does not imply a Luna
  review, approval, or substitute verdict.
- **Acceptance model:** candidate implementation/audit SHAs require fresh,
  independent Sol review at that exact SHA; a prior review of a parent or a
  nearby branch is not acceptance.

The implementation and audit commits below may include a mandatory
`docs/app-workflow-map.html` change from **Updated Jul 23, 2026** to
**Updated Jul 25, 2026**. That is date-only churn from the required hook, not a
substantive workflow-map change or scope expansion.

## Queue state

### DONE

- The queue implementation/audits described below are complete in their
  assigned isolated worktrees, subject to the exact-SHA acceptance status
  explicitly recorded per lane.
- Section 2 has no duplicate remediation lane: its statement correction is
  already canonical on `origin/main`.
- The gauntlet index/summary reconciliation evidence plan is complete; edits
  are intentionally not made while the target files contain root-worktree
  changes.
- This ledger was created from exact `origin/main`
  `25363345adeabb5b2b08a3772a0de3f0edcb3952` in the clean worktree and branch
  listed in the provenance table below.

### NOW

Queue implementation/audits are complete. This ledger candidate awaits fresh
independent Sol acceptance at its exact SHA. It is not authorization to land a
branch, apply a migration, repair live data, invoke an Edge Function, or deploy
production.

### REMAINING — separately authorized work, not part of this goal

- Land any candidate only through its own PR, required checks, and fresh
  exact-SHA review; none is on `main` merely because it appears here.
- For Section 1, obtain the future guarded live-apply approval and run the
  post-apply proof only after that approved landing/apply sequence.
- For Section 9, build and review a forward reconciliation migration, prove a
  zero-row preflight, obtain Mason's explicit approval, then perform the
  same-session guarded apply and listed postflight. No Section 9 live repair
  has happened here.
- For Sections 11 and 12, decide and separately authorize the documented
  coverage/real-path follow-ups; no deploy or live invocation is implied.

### PARKED — preserve user work

`docs/audits/gauntlet/live-foundation-gauntlet-index.md` and
`docs/audits/gauntlet/live-foundation-gauntlet-summary.md` already have dirty
root-worktree changes. The reconciliation evidence is ready, but edits to
those two files are parked to avoid overwriting or mixing with user work. The
stale claims to reconcile when the owner of those changes provides a clean
handoff are:

- Section 2: the already-resolved statement fix/live-ledger state.
- Section 3: stale inventory finding/status language.
- Section 4: stale lifecycle remediation/status language.
- Section 7: its commission-recipient issue is resolved live; only stale
  gauntlet wording awaits reconciliation. This is separate from the eight empty
  SEED batches, which are not evidence of an unresolved Section 7 defect.
- Section 9: the outdated ready-to-apply claim; current live evidence blocks
  it as described below.

## Exact provenance and current state

| Lane | Exact SHA / branch / worktree | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ledger | Base `25363345adeabb5b2b08a3772a0de3f0edcb3952`; `codex/noninterference-queue-ledger-20260725`; `C:\\Users\\mason\\.codex\\worktrees\\noninterference-queue-ledger-20260725\\CRX_Manager` | Local documentation candidate only; no push. |
| Section 1 | `53f6177eb6afe628c5de437ac27f4a9cd8fbb7cf`; `codex/section1-security-hardening-20260725`; `C:\\Users\\mason\\.codex\\worktrees\\section1-security-hardening-20260725\\CRX_Manager` | Fresh independent Sol round 7: **CLEAN**. Not on `main`, not pushed, and not live. |
| Section 9 canonical source | `34baf4eb38dc1432edf8e889b2456b64cad256ac` on `origin/main`; `supabase/migrations/20260722222742_section9_po_ap_high_remediation.sql` | Canonical repository migration exists, but is not live. |
| Section 11 | `b754bf8db85c1ed163dd3d7af17f678ace32e30f`; `codex/section11-pdf-compliance-refresh-20260725`; `C:\\Users\\mason\\.codex\\worktrees\\section11-pdf-compliance-refresh-20260725\\CRX_Manager` | Fresh independent Sol: **CLEAN**. Not pushed and not on `main`. |

Supplier boundary, volatile and observed read-only during this correction: the
active Supplier Phase 3 Stage B worktree is
`C:\\Users\\mason\\.codex\\worktrees\\supplier-phase3-stage-b-20260725\\CRX_Manager`,
observed at `c306971188e7c84269469580b538bf4d7a04fc5d`, **13 ahead** of
`origin/main`. It currently has separately owned unstaged `.husky/pre-commit`
work and staged SupplierPricing test/page changes. There is no touched-file
overlap with this ledger.

## Section 1 — number generators and `save_field`

Candidate `53f6177eb6afe628c5de437ac27f4a9cd8fbb7cf` hardens the six audited
number generators and the `save_field` actor-attribution path. The review
accepts the pinned, reviewed `save_field` body fingerprint rather than a broad
lexical classifier: PostgreSQL `pg_proc.prosrc` SHA-256
`10a53c6b4c218a3836b0a5269fc558cc214eb8741a2df6669133885919f50ff2`.
It also confirms the narrow actor-binding control. Fresh independent Sol round
7 is **CLEAN** at this candidate SHA.

Recorded proof:

- `test:security`: **263** tests.
- Focused RPC contract proof: **82** tests.
- Registered exact rollback-only smoke for the generators and `save_field`.
- Changed-only SQL audit: no blocker/high finding.
- The candidate's own source ledger records the full local pipeline, including
  the exact smoke proof; live predicate/smoke proof remains a post-apply step.

It is not on `main`, not pushed, and not live. A future PR, then an explicitly
approved guarded live apply and postflight proof, remain mandatory. This ledger
does not perform any of them.

## Section 9 — PO/AP remediation is repository-canonical but live-blocked

`34baf4eb38dc1432edf8e889b2456b64cad256ac` is already an ancestor of
`origin/main` and contains the canonical migration
`20260722222742_section9_po_ap_high_remediation.sql`. It is **not live**.
The **77 Main Warehouse `quantity_on_order` mismatches** are prior read-only
readiness-lane evidence from this governed run on 2026-07-25, produced by
executing the canonical fail-closed preflight; they were not rechecked by this
ledger-only branch. The ledger durably records that result, while tracked
`main` proves only that the canonical migration is pending/not live. Readiness
is therefore **BLOCKED**. The prior Section 9 remediation worktree is stale
**7 behind / 7 ahead** of `origin/main`; it must not be used to apply anything.

Required future path, all outside this ledger:

1. Author and independently review a new forward reconciliation migration;
   never edit the canonical historical migration.
2. Immediately run a fresh zero-row Main Warehouse mismatch preflight against
   the current production state.
3. Produce same-session guarded apply proof and obtain Mason's explicit live
   approval.
4. Apply the reviewed reconciliation migration, then apply canonical Section 9
   migration `20260722222742_section9_po_ap_high_remediation.sql` in that
   governed sequence.
5. Verify live migration-ledger/B7 identity and run the registered
   `section9_po_ap_high_remediation` rollback-only smoke to
   `SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK`.
6. Run `section9-po-ap-controls` and the full invariant sweep; verify live
   triggers, functions, grants, and policies; then refresh live-derived
   registry/docs and publish an explicit state closeout.

No write, migration apply, or live repair was made by this queue ledger.

## Section 2 — closed; do not duplicate

The statement correction is already resolved on `origin/main` by
`20260720173059_fix_statement_opening_balance.sql`, with live migration-ledger
version `20260720185135`. Its deterministic statement ordering uses
`source_rank`, a stable UUID tie-breaker (`sort_id`), and an explicit `ROWS`
window frame. This queue contains no second implementation, migration, or
landing request for Section 2.

## Section 11 — PDFs and compliance documents

Candidate `b754bf8db85c1ed163dd3d7af17f678ace32e30f` is a documentation/audit
refresh with a fresh independent Sol **CLEAN** verdict. It records **0
defects**, **2 MEDIUM coverage gaps**, and a blocked authenticated binary-PDF
proof. Focused proof passed **112** tests. The limitation is deliberate:
mocked renderer tests do not demonstrate a real authenticated browser download,
visual pagination, or binary output.

The candidate is neither pushed nor on `main`; no production state changed.

## Section 12 — Edge Functions

Candidate `a94ef7f1e8050667314d9c7bddc1ea36be3a46ba` has a fresh independent Sol
**CLEAN** verdict. It records **one MEDIUM** issue: a user re-click of email
send can create a different time-derived idempotency key and therefore is not
deduplicated as the same intentional action. Read-only live metadata observed
seven active deployed functions with `verify_jwt=true`.

Focused proof passed **85** tests. Limits remain: metadata did not prove
deployed-bundle parity, deployed secrets, or a real authenticated OCR/email
transaction. The candidate is not pushed, not on `main`, and not deployed by
this work; a real safe non-production proof and any remediation/deployment
require their own authorization.

## Proof boundary

This ledger verified that its base SHA equals current `origin/main`, that the
listed candidate SHAs and worktrees exist, that the Section 9 and Section 2
commits are ancestors of `origin/main`, and that its cumulative diff is limited
to the substantive ledger plus mandatory app-workflow-map date-only churn.
Candidate test counts and Sol verdicts above are recorded lane evidence, not a
claim that this documentation-only branch reran every candidate's test suite
or performed a live operation.
