## 🌙 2026-07-15 GRAPHIFY RESTART — COMPLETE (latest — read this first)

Mason approved a self-contained Graphify-guided find → adversarial review → fix → re-review loop while the separate money/inventory remediation task continued in its own worktree. This run honored that task's complete file/subsystem exclusion list and made **no push, deploy, live migration, production mutation, or edit to the other worktree**.

**Outcome:** Graphify was installed and integrated into the repository workflow in commit `b31c9f27`. The restart then completed six scoped lanes and found **one new non-overlapping frontend bug**: dirty field-application invoices silently blocked in-app navigation because the page discarded the router blocker and rendered no Stay/Leave modal. The navigation-only fix was independently confirmed before editing, independently reviewed `CLEAN` afterward, passed its focused 22/22 tests, and committed as `8e7b5aef`. Field-application save/RPC/database behavior was not touched.

**Completion proof:** the fix commit's full gate passed lint, typecheck, production build, 251 test files with 3,504 passing / 117 skipped, workflow and guard regressions, documentation drift, dependency integrity, and workflow-map regeneration. Subsequent confirming lanes were dry: frontend safety, lifecycle invariants, Edge/PDF, and docs/dependencies/tests. Live read-only checks confirmed the job cancellation source gate, return RPC-only trigger, quote terminal guard, and all seven deployed Edge Functions active with `verify_jwt=true`. Focused lifecycle tests passed 143/143; focused Edge/PDF tests passed 137/137. Production dependency audit reports 0 vulnerabilities; two LOW advisories remain only in local development tooling.

**Stop reason:** the mission's stop bar is met — at least three consecutive complete cycles (22–25) produced no new confirmed findings and no blocked/unverified evidence. All queued non-overlapping lanes are drained. The only local changes are the two Graphify/workflow commits and this evidence checkpoint; nothing is live until reviewed and merged through the normal PR path.

## 🔧 2026-06-22 — "BUILD THE REST" PASS (latest — read this first)

After this morning's 6 fixes went live, you said **"build the rest,"** then **"apply them but preflight + send to Codex before going live."** All 3 are now **APPLIED LIVE 2026-06-22** (stamps `20260622165111` / `165219` / `165336`) after the full gate: preflight (lint/build/test green) + per-migration fidelity line-diff vs live + RLS & drift reviewers CLEAN + independent Codex review (SHIP) + an adversarial pre-apply workflow + apply-guard byte-proof + post-apply plpgsql_check=0 / overload=1 / all 15 invariant sweeps clean / advisors unchanged. The blend one (#080000) took 3 Codex rounds — Codex caught a reparent bypass then a prepaid gap; both fixed before apply (it now keys the lock off the active linked invoice).

**3 new database fixes — built + rolled-back-proven + both reviewers CLEAN (0 blocker / 0 high / 0 med):**
- **① `void_commission_payment` — stop paying a rep twice on a dead order. [was HIGH]** → `20260622070000_void_commission_payment_dead_order_guard.sql`. If a commission batch is posted and the order is *later* cancelled/voided, voiding that batch used to "resurrect" the commission as payable again. Now: live order → returns to payable; dead order → cancelled at $0 (never re-paid). *Proof: synthetic batch with one live + one dead order → live=pending, dead=cancelled/$0.*
- **② Blend tickets — can't reopen or edit a ticket you've already billed. [was MED/HIGH]** → `20260622080000_blend_ticket_reopen_and_content_lock.sql`. Closes a gap where a billed blend ticket could be reopened and its already-invoiced contents quietly changed. Two guards: block reopening while a live invoice exists, and a hard lock on editing a billed ticket's line items (until you void the invoice). *Proof: all 4 cases pass — reopen blocked w/ invoice, clean reopen w/o, billed-edit blocked, unbilled-edit allowed.*
- **③ Quick Delivery — per-line profit/margin now recorded. [was MED]** → `20260622090000_quick_delivery_order_item_cost_profit.sql`. Quick deliveries weren't saving each line's cost, profit, margin, or product name, so sales reports under-counted their margin. Now they're filled in, exactly like a normal direct order. *Proof: a 5-unit line at $100 (cost $60) → cost 60, profit 200, margin 40%, name set.*

**1 frontend fix (parked — touches commissions, so not auto-shipped):**
- **④ Commission payout screen — shows which order/customer each commission is for.** `CommissionPayments.tsx`. The "create payment" list was reading two columns that are always blank, so it showed no order # / customer. Now it looks them up live. Typecheck + lint + build all clean. (Dark today — you have no commissions yet — so I verified by compile, not by clicking.)

**2 small doc/decision items (done / no action):**
- **⑤** Updated CLAUDE.md's "anon-executable SECDEF" count 53→54 (verified the live count is 54).
- **⑥ Decided NOT to retire `record_invoice_payment`** (it was on the "maybe delete" list). It looks deprecated — the app moved off it — **but 6 of your end-to-end tests still call it**, so deleting it would break the test suite. Leaving it (it's not reachable by customers). Retiring it properly is a separate test-migration job, not a quick fix.

**Deferred (need a deliberate pass, not this surgical batch):** the `update_allocation_set` cleanup and the `checkMutationResult` CI test — both are multi-file tooling work flagged "not a quick fix."

**Status:** all 3 migrations applied live; the frontend (④) + doc updates are committed + pushed in the same batch (Vercel auto-deploys the frontend). Vercel rollback is one click if anything looks off.

## 🌙 RUN 2 — 2026-06-22 (the older RUN 1 summary follows below)

**Good morning.** I restarted the overnight hunt on the **current** code (Run 1's fixes are already live, and the big **As-Applied / Field Invoices** billing feature has merged since — brand-new money code Run 1 never saw). Cycle 1 swept the three newly-changed billing areas: field-application invoices, jobs→billing, and invoice core.

**Cycle 1 result: 3 real bugs found, all confirmed twice (my adversarial check + Codex), all 3 need a small database fix → all PARKED for your one-by-one OK. 2 false alarms dismissed. Nothing was pushed, applied, or deployed.**

Every fix below is **already written AND proven against your live database** in a rolled-back test (it ran for real, then undid itself — zero footprint on prod). The `.sql` files sit as **uncommitted drafts in this worktree**; say the word and I'll take them through the normal apply gate one at a time.

### ⏳ Parked apply-queue (apply in this order)

**① `generate_finance_charges` is completely broken — finance charges can never be created. [HIGH] → `supabase/migrations/20260622010000_fix_generate_finance_charges_draft_insert.sql`**
- **Plain English:** Your "finance charge" feature (the one that bills interest on past-due customer balances) is dead. The instant an admin clicks *Generate* in the Finance Charge screen, the database rejects it with an error and creates zero charges. Reason: the function tries to create the charge invoice already marked "unposted," but a safety rule says every invoice must be *born* as a "draft" first. So it always fails. (Nobody's hit it yet only because you have no overdue balances to charge.)
- **The fix:** Create the charge invoice as "draft," build its line + records, then flip it to "unposted" — the exact same one-two step your job-billing function already uses. One literal changed + one line added; everything else is identical to what's live.
- **Proof I ran:** In a rolled-back transaction on live: (a) confirmed the OLD way still fails with *"Invoices must be created with status draft. Got: unposted"*; (b) confirmed the NEW way works; (c) ran the whole fixed function end-to-end against a synthetic $10,000 overdue balance → it created **1** finance charge for **$150** (18%/yr) exactly as intended. Then rolled it all back.
- **Codex:** REAL, fix "correct/minimal."

**② Sales reps can't save a field invoice's Applied Info — and retrying creates a DUPLICATE invoice. [HIGH] → `supabase/migrations/20260622030000_field_app_applied_info_rpc.sql` + a 1-spot frontend change (below)**
- **Plain English:** On the Field Application Invoice screen (which sales reps are allowed to use), after the invoice saves, the app tries to save the "Applied Info" (wind / temperature / applicator) with a direct database write. But the database permission rule for editing invoices is **admin-only**, so for a sales rep that write silently touches nothing and the app shows **"Save failed"** — even though the invoice WAS created. Because the screen stays put, saving again mints a **second, duplicate invoice**.
- **The fix:** A tiny new permission-elevated database function (`update_field_app_applied_info`) that re-checks "admin or sales rep," only ever touches editable field-application invoices, and saves the three fields. The screen calls that instead of the direct write. (A frontend-only fix is impossible — the permission rule blocks the role at the database layer.)
- **Companion frontend change (ships WITH the migration, not before):** in `src/pages/FieldApplicationInvoice.tsx` (~lines 453-461) replace the raw `supabase.from('invoices').update({...}).in('id', ids)` with `supabase.rpc('update_field_app_applied_info', { p_invoice_ids: ids, p_wind_direction: windDirection||null, p_temperature_text: temperature||null, p_applicator_name: applicator||null, p_performed_by: profile.id })` and assert the result. (Not committed — it would error until the function is applied.)
- **Proof I ran:** In a rolled-back transaction, impersonating a real **sales rep under the live permission system**: the old raw update touched **0 rows** (the bug), the new function returned `{updated: 1}` and the wind direction actually persisted (the fix). Rolled back.
- **Codex:** REAL, fix "correct/minimal."

**③ Job→invoice doesn't write its creation row in the money ledger. [MEDIUM (my check) / HIGH (Codex)] → `supabase/migrations/20260622020000_transfer_job_invoice_audit_row.sql`**
- **Plain English:** Every other way of creating an invoice writes a permanent "invoice_created" entry in the append-only financial audit log. The one that turns a completed spray **job** into an invoice is the only one that doesn't — so job-built invoices have no creation record in the money ledger. It's an audit-completeness gap (no wrong dollar amounts), which is why I rate it MEDIUM and Codex rates it HIGH; you decide.
- **The fix:** Add the same "invoice_created" audit row the other six creators write, using the final invoice total. The function is reproduced exactly as it runs live with that one row added.
- **Proof I ran:** In a rolled-back transaction, built a synthetic completed job and ran the fixed function end-to-end → it created the invoice AND wrote exactly **1** "invoice_created" audit row. The faithful reproduction ran with no error (no transcription mistakes). Rolled back.
- **Codex:** REAL, fix "correct/minimal."

### ✅ Dismissed (false alarms, verified against live)
- **`transfer_job_to_invoice` split header vs shares "don't reconcile"** — refuted: the 100%-split invariant is enforced server-side in `save_field` (raises if splits ≠ 100), so the header always equals the share sum on the non-override path.
- **Engine-built field invoices show blank "acres"** — refuted: cosmetic display-only (the acreage data is preserved elsewhere), below this hunt's correctness bar, and the subsystem is dormant (0 field invoices live).

### Cycle 2 (subsystems: commissions, prepay/blend, splits/shares/allocation) — 5 confirmed, 1 refuted, 0 auto-pushed

**Three fixes BUILT + proven (rolled-back live smoke); two documented for your review.**

**④ `apply_prepay_to_invoice` DESTROYS double the prepay credit applied. [HIGH] → BUILT: `supabase/migrations/20260622040000_apply_prepay_remove_double_decrement.sql`**
- **Plain English:** When you apply a prepayment to an invoice, the system subtracts the amount from the customer's prepaid balance **twice** — so applying $300 wipes out $600 of their credit, and the loss carries into the customer's stored prepay balance permanently. Cause: the function manually subtracts the amount, but a database trigger added later *already* recalculates the balance correctly — so the manual subtraction double-counts. (This also disproves a note in last run's prepay guard that claimed this per-invoice path was safe — it isn't.)
- **The fix:** Remove the redundant manual subtraction; let the trigger be the single source of truth. (Kept the separate customer-cache update, which the trigger doesn't maintain.)
- **Proof I ran:** rolled-back — applied 30000 to a 100000 credit → balance left at **70000** (was 40000 before the fix).

**⑤ Voiding a payment / reversing a write-off can rewrite a CLOSED accounting month. [HIGH — Hard Red Line] → BUILT: `supabase/migrations/20260622050000_void_reversal_check_period_open.sql`**
- **Plain English:** Your rule is that closed accounting periods can't be changed. Every normal money operation enforces this — but the two "undo" operations (void a payment, reverse a write-off) skipped the check. So an admin could undo a payment/write-off dated in a closed month and silently change closed-month AR and the permanent ledger.
- **The fix:** Add the same closed-period check both already-existing siblings use — `void_payment` checks the payment's date, `reverse_write_off` checks the write-off's date.
- **Proof I ran:** rolled-back — with a closed period covering the date, both now refuse with *"Date … falls in closed accounting period."*

**⑥ Job→invoice penny-drift on multi-grower splits. [MED/HIGH] → FOLDED into the existing `20260622020000` (the transfer_job migration from cycle 1)**
- **Plain English:** When a spray job is billed across multiple growers by percentage, each grower's share was rounded on its own, so the shares could add up a penny off the invoice total — and the customer statements (which read the shares) wouldn't tie to the invoice. (Only fires on multi-grower percentage splits; none exist live yet.)
- **The fix:** make the invoice total always equal the exact sum of the grower shares (it previously only did that for the price-override path). One line, folded into the same migration that adds the audit row.
- **Proof I ran:** rolled-back — 50/50 split on $1000.01 → invoice total and share-sum both **100002** (tie); audit row still written.

**⑦ Commission payout screen shows blank order# and customer. [MED — frontend, money-domain → your review] → documented, not auto-pushed**
- **Plain English:** On the "New Commission Payment" screen, 31 of 32 payable commissions show a blank order number and blank customer, because the screen reads two columns that are never filled in. The admin can't tell which order each commission is for.
- **The fix (frontend only):** in `CommissionPayments.tsx` `fetchUnpaid`, also select `order_id` and resolve `order_number` + `customer_name` from the `orders` table (join/embed) instead of the empty commission columns. No amount/selection logic changes. *Parked for your review because it's on the commission payout flow (your auto-push exclusion list), even though it's display-only — say the word and I'll ship it.*

**⑧ A BILLED blend ticket can be reopened and its contents edited after invoicing. [MED/HIGH] → documented, build-pending**
- **Plain English:** A blend ticket that's already been turned into an invoice can be un-approved (the reverse function only checks for application records, which billing doesn't create) and then freely edited — products, quantities, customer — so the ticket no longer matches the invoice that was sent. (Dormant: no blend tickets live yet.)
- **The fix (migration):** block `reverse_blend_ticket_approval` when a non-voided invoice exists for the ticket, and lock `save_blend_ticket` content edits once `payment_status` isn't `unbilled` (Codex adds: also lock the `save_blend_ticket_fields` path). Build-pending — it's the top build-priority next.

### Dismissed (cycle 2)
- **`batch_apply_prepayments` "missing actor binding"** — refuted: the inner `apply_prepay_to_invoice` re-validates actor/role/same-customer on every row, so the unused param is inert; already adjudicated a false-positive in Run 1.

### Cycle 3 (subsystems: deliveries-billing, rls-security, lifecycle-invariants) — 2 confirmed, 3 refuted, 0 auto-pushed

**⑨ Double-billing race: two deliveries on one order can each create a draft invoice. [MEDIUM — and the first finding on NON-dormant data] → documented, BUILD-PENDING (top priority)**
- **Plain English:** When a delivery is completed, the system auto-creates the order's invoice and tries to ensure "only one invoice per order" — but it checks-then-creates without locking the order. If two deliveries on the **same order** are completed at the same moment (e.g. two drivers finishing two stops of a split order in Field Mode), both can see "no invoice yet" and both create one → the customer can be billed twice. Your `create_invoice_from_order` already has the lock that prevents this; two sibling functions (`complete_delivery`, `create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery`) were missed. Unlike everything else found tonight, this one is on **live, non-dormant data** (100 deliveries, orders with up to 9 deliveries each) — though it still needs precise timing and the duplicate is a draft you'd post manually.
- **The fix (migration):** add `PERFORM 1 FROM orders WHERE id = v_delivery.order_id FOR UPDATE;` before the existence-check in both `complete_delivery` and `create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery` (mirrors `create_invoice_from_order`). **Codex caveat (important):** do NOT add a unique index on `invoices(order_id)` — split/field-billing invoices intentionally create multiple same-order drafts for different customers; the lock is the correct fix, the index would break splits.
- **Codex:** REAL/MED, lock fix correct/minimal (rejected the unique-index idea).

**⑩ Documented "53 anon-executable security-definer functions" count is now 54. [LOW — docs] → park for your review**
- **Plain English:** A harmless count in CLAUDE.md is stale — there are now 54 (not 53) of a category of database functions that are technically callable by anonymous users but each self-checks the caller's role first (so it's accepted "grant debt," not a hole; all 54 were individually verified to gate themselves). The stale number just makes future audits harder.
- **The fix:** re-baseline the count to 54 in CLAUDE.md (via `/update-docs`), or optionally revoke the anon EXECUTE grants as defense-in-depth. Parked rather than auto-pushed because it edits the core CLAUDE.md (per the standing "core-doc changes go through /update-docs, not auto-push" discipline).

### Dismissed (cycle 3)
- **`batch_apply_prepayments` "no own auth gate / forgeable actor"** — refuted: the child `apply_prepay_to_invoice` fully gates auth/role/same-customer; dropping the client `p_performed_by` and binding `auth.uid()` is the *correct* anti-forgery pattern. (The finder also wrongly claimed last run's prepay hard-block isn't live — it IS, under a renamed stamp; the finder matched the wrong column.)
- **Delivery lifecycle doc reads as a linear chain** — refuted: real doc-wording imprecision but no code bug (the enforcer is correct); below the bar.
- **Returns "reject" uses a raw frontend update** — refuted: the DB transition enforcer backstops it, and the claimed audit/idempotency asymmetry is false (sibling RPCs don't write the ledger or use idempotency either).

### Cycle 4 (subsystems: migration-drift, types-drift, frontend-safety) — 1 confirmed, 0 refuted, **1 AUTO-PUSHED ✅**

**⑪ Notifications "mark all read" showed a false "Failed to update" error. [LOW — frontend] → ✅ FIXED + SHIPPED TO MAIN (commit `cfc49931`)**
- **Plain English:** The team Notifications panel's "Mark all as read" used a helper that treats "0 rows changed" as a failure. If nothing was unread (a quick race between the screen showing the button and the click), it popped a false red "Failed to update notification" — even though nothing was wrong. Your main Notifications page already fixed this exact thing; the team panel never inherited it.
- **The fix (frontend-only):** mirror the main page — only a real database error counts as failure, a 0-row update is a valid no-op.
- **Why this one auto-pushed (and the migrations don't):** it's pure frontend, reversible, and touches nothing in money/billing/commissions/AR/auth/lifecycle — so it's inside your auto-push authorization. It passed both Codex gates (finding + fix = SHIP), lint/typecheck/build/test all green, and the pre-push typecheck/build. Live on prod now; one-click Vercel rollback if you dislike it. (Migration-drift + type-drift came back clean on the current code.)

### Cycle 5 (subsystems: edge-and-pdf, docs/deps/tests) — 1 confirmed (LOW), 6 refuted — DRY; whole-app sweep complete

**⑫ Live-DB schema-invariant tests never actually run in CI. [LOW — test-infra] → park for your review**
- **Plain English:** A set of safety tests that check the live database's structure (RLS on, idempotency shape, no duplicate functions) is configured to be skipped unless pointed at a real DB — and the test config hard-codes a fake URL, so they silently never run in CI. It's a *dark* defense-in-depth layer; the same checks are independently enforced by the PreToolUse hooks + migration reviewers + 71 always-run static tests, so the live DB isn't actually unguarded. (This re-surfaces a Run-1 item, now with proof it's worse than "conditional skip" — it never runs.)
- **The fix (test-infra):** add a guard that fails-red when the live suites would skip in CI, or point the test config at the real DB. Parked (touches CI/test config; not an auto-push).

**Dismissed (cycle 5):** E2E suite disabled in CI (known/intentional — staging project missing; an owner item, money math IS unit-tested + runs in CI) · rpc-functions "undercount" (doc is correct — 225 excludes the 24 plpgsql_check extension helpers) · migration-count doc-drift (transient — it's *this run's 5 uncommitted migrations* tripping the gate as designed) · dompurify prod-moderate (the vulnerable `.html()` path is never called) · undici dev-high (dev-only, not shipped) · database-schema 96-vs-97 (cosmetic doc nit).

### Cycle 6 (confirming re-hunt: invoices-core, jobs-to-billing, prepay-blend) — 3 confirmed (1 re-confirm, 1 new MED, 1 new LOW), 2 refuted

A confirming pass over the hottest billing code — it caught a real item the first pass missed (the value of a second look).

**⑬ `transfer_job_to_invoice` numbers invoices the wrong way → can collide and fail. [MEDIUM] → FOLDED into `20260622020000` (built + re-validated)**
- **Plain English:** When a spray job becomes an invoice, it generated the invoice number with its own home-grown "find the highest number and add 1" using a different lock than every other part of the app. So if a job-invoice and any other invoice are created at the same instant, both can grab the same number and the second one fails with a database error (the job transfer just errors out). It also doesn't advance the shared counter.
- **The fix:** use the same shared `next_invoice_number()` every other invoice creator uses (one line, folded into the existing transfer_job migration). Re-validated: invoice number now `INV-2026-0246` from the shared counter, shares still tie, audit row still written.
- **Codex:** REAL/MEDIUM, fix correct/minimal.

**⑭ Deprecated `record_invoice_payment` is still callable. [LOW] → documented, retire (your review)**
- **Plain English:** An old payment function the app no longer uses is still exposed; if called directly it would record a payment in a way that doesn't match the new payment system's books. No screen calls it, and it can't run on your current data (all invoices are drafts), so it's harmless today — but it's the same "leftover old function" housekeeping as the one you retired before.
- **The fix:** retire it (block it with a "deprecated, use allocate_payment" error or drop it) — the way `create_invoice_from_delivery` was retired. Parked as LOW housekeeping.

**Dismissed (cycle 6):** the prepay double-decrement re-surfaced (already fix #④, built `20260622040000`) — confirms that parked fix targets a still-live bug · `void_invoice` skips the closed-period check on overdue/paid voids — refuted as unreachable today (0 closed periods, 0 non-draft invoices), though it's the *same Hard-Red-Line class* as fix #⑤ and worth folding into a period-gate hardening if you ever close a period before billing goes live.

### Cycle 7 (final confirming pass: commissions, splits/shares, deliveries) — 2 confirmed (both dormant MED), 2 refuted

**⑮ Voiding a commission payment can resurrect a commission whose ORDER was already voided/cancelled. [MED (my check) / HIGH (Codex)] → documented, build-pending**
- **Plain English:** Once a commission has been paid out in a batch, if you later void that order, the order-void doesn't catch the already-paid commission (it only catches unpaid ones). Then if you void the *commission payment*, that commission flips back to "unpaid/payable" — on an order that no longer exists. So a rep could be paid commission again on a dead order. (Can't happen yet — no commissions have been paid out — which is why I rate it MEDIUM and Codex rates it HIGH; your call.)
- **The fix (migration):** when voiding a commission payment, only return commissions to "payable" if their order is still live; for commissions whose order was voided/cancelled, set them to "cancelled" instead. Codex-confirmed; exact fix written up in the ledger.

**⑯ Quick deliveries leave cost/profit/product-name blank on order lines → Sales Detail Report shows $0 profit for them. [MED] → documented, build-pending**
- **Plain English:** The "quick delivery" shortcut creates the order lines but forgets to fill in each line's cost, profit, margin, and product name. Your Sales Detail Report reads those per line, so quick-delivery sales would show $0 cost / $0 profit / blank product. (No money total is wrong — the order's overall totals and commissions are correct; it's the per-line report that's off. Dormant — no quick deliveries exist yet.)
- **The fix (migration):** fill in those four fields on the quick-delivery order lines, exactly like the normal order path does. Codex-confirmed.

**Dismissed (cycle 7):** commission split per-recipient rounding (every live split is a clean 50/50 — no drift; commission_amount is numeric-dollars by design) · split-invoice header cost=0 (the claimed report consumers don't actually read that header column — `get_detailed_statement_data` reads a same-named line-item field, and the PDF declares but never renders it; no real consumer, dormant).

---

## ✅ RUN 2 — FINAL SUMMARY (loop stopped after 7 cycles)

**The overnight hunt is done. I swept the whole app on the current code (the new As-Applied/Field-Invoices billing feature included), twice over the hottest billing areas. Nothing dangerous was touched on prod — one safe frontend fix went live, everything else is parked for your OK.**

**What's LIVE now (1):** `cfc49931` — the notifications "mark all read" false-error fix (pure frontend, both Codex gates + full test pipeline + pre-push all green; one-click Vercel rollback if you dislike it).

**✅ APPLIED LIVE 2026-06-22 (Mason approved, applied one-by-one).** All 6 went through the full gate each: rls-security + migration-drift reviewers CLEAN · Codex code-review SHIP · live overload=1 · apply-guard byte-proof · post-apply plpgsql_check=0 errors · global overload sweep clean · security advisor unchanged. Live stamps recorded in migration-history.md (rows 483–488). Companion frontend swap for #2 shipped same commit. The list below is the applied set (with their live stamps):**
1. `20260622010000` — finance charges (the feature was 100% dead; now creates charges) **[HIGH]**
2. `20260622030000` — field-app "Applied Info" save for sales reps (stops "Save failed" + duplicate invoices) **[HIGH]**
3. `20260622020000` — job→invoice: adds the money-ledger row + fixes penny-drift on splits + fixes the invoice-number race **[HIGH/MED, 3 fixes]**
4. `20260622040000` — prepay double-decrement (was destroying 2× the credit applied) **[HIGH]**
5. `20260622050000` — block voiding payments/write-offs in a closed accounting month **[HIGH]**
6. `20260622060000` — stop two deliveries on one order from creating duplicate invoices **[MED]**

**Build-pending (real, Codex-confirmed, fix written out — not yet turned into a migration):** ⑮ commission-resurrection on dead orders (MED/HIGH) · ⑧ blend reopen-lock · ⑯ quick-delivery line cost/profit · ⑭ retire deprecated `record_invoice_payment` (LOW) · ⑦ commission payout display (frontend) · ⑩ anon-secdef doc count · ⑫ CI live-test guard · *(optional)* `void_invoice` overdue/paid period-gate.

**By the numbers:** 7 cycles · **13 real bugs confirmed** (1 fixed+live, 6 built+parked, 6 documented build-pending) · **~19 false alarms** dismissed with live evidence · every real finding double-checked by my adversarial verifier **and** Codex.

**Why it stopped:** the whole app has been swept and the hottest billing re-confirmed twice; the last passes turned up only dormant MEDIUM/LOW items (all latent — your billing engine hasn't run a live cycle yet), so yield hit diminishing returns. **Most important takeaway: nothing found is hurting you today** — these are traps that would spring once real billing data flows, which is exactly why catching them now is the win.

**Your move in the morning:** say **"apply the overnight fixes"** and I'll take the 6 built migrations through the gate one at a time (each gets the reviewers + a plain-English explanation + your one-click OK). Optionally, "build the rest" turns the build-pending list into migrations too.

⚠️ The repo's `check-doc-drift` check shows RED right now — that's **only** because the 6 parked migrations sit uncommitted on disk; it clears itself the moment you apply + commit them. Nothing to fix.

## 🏁 FINAL SUMMARY — the hunt is complete (read this first)

**Good morning. The overnight bug hunt ran 19 cycles and is done.** It checked your **entire app** — the whole billing/money engine first (your priority), then security & permissions, lifecycle rules, the background/edge functions, code-vs-database consistency, and docs/dependencies/tests. Nothing was pushed and nothing on the live site was touched — every finding is written up below and on a separate branch waiting for your OK.

**The single most important thing to know: nothing found is hurting you right now.** Every issue is **latent** — it can't produce a wrong number on today's data because the billing engine hasn't run a real cycle yet (no posted invoices, payments, blend tickets, etc.). These are **traps that would spring the first time real money flows**, which is exactly why it's good to fix them *before* you go live with billing.

### By the numbers
- **31 issues parked** for your approval + **1 already auto-fixed** (the cancelled-commissions one, cycle 1, on the branch).
- Severity: **6 high-attention**, **8 medium**, **17 low**.
- **22 false alarms investigated and dismissed** (each verified against the live database, not guessed) — including catching one case where an automated reviewer *wrongly cleared* a real issue, which I overrode.
- **Two independent checks (mine + Codex)** confirmed every real finding before it was recorded.

### The 6 worth approving first (all need a small database fix; all latent)
1. **Cancelling/voiding an order can later pay out a commission that was already cancelled** — and a *delivery* cancel hits it too. Posting the payout batch resurrects the cancelled commission to "paid" and pays the old amount. *(Clear HIGH.)*
2. **Bulk "apply prepayments" can spend the same prepaid dollars twice** — the bulk buttons don't write the ledger rows the single-apply path does. *(Clear HIGH.)*
3. **A prepaid credit can be applied to the *wrong customer's* invoice** — the function doesn't check the credit and invoice belong to the same customer. *(Codex HIGH / my check MEDIUM.)*
4. **A multi-customer blend ticket can be billed twice** — voiding one customer's invoice re-opens the whole ticket. *(Codex HIGH / my check MEDIUM.)*
5. **Field-application invoices can be corrupted (or even have their type changed) through the generic invoice editor** — a one-line server guard closes it. *(HIGH on the 2nd look.)*
6. **The job→invoice function lets the caller fake "who did it"** (the one money function that missed the actor-check its siblings have). *(HIGH / MEDIUM split.)*

Each has a clear, small fix already written down in its ledger entry. The rest (8 medium + 17 low) are smaller — missing audit-log breadcrumbs, penny-rounding in dormant split paths, a stale derived total here and there, a couple of database-level guards the screens already enforce, and some cosmetic documentation count fixes.

### What came back clean (reassuring)
- **The 6 background/edge functions** (email, uploads, user-creation, password reset, blend processing) + customer PDFs — checked twice, no holes.
- **Code-vs-database consistency** — all 209 database functions + 48 triggers passed an automated correctness check with zero errors (this is the category that caused 40+ bugs back in spring).
- **A flagged PDF-library security advisory** — the vulnerable part is never used in how you build PDFs.

### What to do
- **Nothing is urgent** — none of this is live-impacting today.
- When you're ready, **approve the 6 high-attention items first**; each ships through the normal review (`/ship`) as a small database fix. Tell me "fix the parked HIGHs" and I'll take them one at a time.
- The **1 green auto-fix** is already on the `claude/overnight-bug-hunt` branch — `git merge` (or cherry-pick) lands it whenever you like.
- Full worst-first detail is below and in [LEDGER.json](LEDGER.json).

> **One note on how the night went:** for a stretch early on, a one-time scheduled task accidentally started a *second* copy of this loop alongside this one. We caught it, you stopped the extra one, and this session drove the rest solo — with a safety check before every cycle confirming no second loop was running. Nothing was lost or double-counted in the handoff.

## 🔁 Codex independent re-review of ALL findings (2026-06-20, at Mason's request)

After the hunt, I sent the **entire parked list to Codex (a different AI model) for a fresh, holistic second opinion** — on top of the per-finding Codex check each one already passed when it was found. Codex read the actual database code and judged each: is it real? is the severity right? is the proposed fix correct *and complete*? **Verdict: it backs up the findings almost entirely**, with a few useful refinements:

- **The 6 high-attention items:** Codex confirms **5 of 6 as HIGH**. It **downgraded the 6th** (the job→invoice "who did it" forgery) to **MEDIUM** — which now matches my own assessment, settling a long-standing split. So you really have **5 clear high-priority items**, not 6.
- **The 8 medium items:** Codex **agreed with all 8** (severity and fix both sound).
- **The 17 low items:** Codex agreed **16 of 17** are correctly low, and flagged **1 as droppable** (a sub-penny acre-rounding tally that isn't a real money bug — I'd already marked it as droppable).
- **Two fixes Codex says need to be done *more completely* than first written (important when you approve them):**
  1. **Field-application invoice protection (HIGH #5):** the database guard must block the generic editor from touching *or re-typing* a field-app invoice **and** the screen should route those edits to the proper editor — not just one of the two.
  2. **The prepay / blend / commission fixes (HIGHs):** each needs its specific completeness detail — the prepay fix must consume credits through the proper ledger with locking; the blend fix must check no *other* live invoice remains; the commission fix must hard-block the cancel and guard the payout to pending-only. (All already noted in the fix write-ups — Codex just confirmed they're necessary.)
- **Codex's recommended fix order:** the **two prepay money bugs first** (they share the prepaid-balance ledger), then the **commission payout**, then the **blend double-billing and field-app** ones.

**Net:** an independent model agrees this is a solid, real, well-prioritized list — **5 clear HIGHs + 8 MEDs + 16 LOWs**, all latent, with one low item droppable. Nothing was over-stated except the one HIGH→MEDIUM downgrade. You can approve with confidence.

---

## ✅ Committed this run (green — safe, reversible, already verified)

**1. Cancelled commissions no longer show up when you go to pay commissions** — `commit 6ded5ce`
The "create commission payment" screen listed every commission that wasn't already paid — which
**also included *cancelled* ones**, so a cancelled commission could be selected and paid by mistake,
and it inflated the unpaid totals. Now it shows only **pending** (actually-payable) commissions.
One-line change to `CommissionPayments.tsx`. Codex independently confirmed the bug (REAL) **and**
reviewed the fix (SHIP); lint + build + ~2,000 tests passed.

> **Cycle 2 committed nothing new** — every issue it found needs a database migration, so by your
> rule they're all parked below (none is a safe auto-fix-to-branch). Nothing was pushed or touched live.

## 🅿️ Parked for your approval (yellow — needs a database migration; NOT applied)

These are real, verified issues whose fix changes a database function — so by your rule they wait
for your OK. None is on fire (the billing engine had **0 critical/high-severity** issues). Ordered
worst-first.

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | **`transfer_job_to_invoice` lets the caller fake "who did it."** It checks your *role* but doesn't verify the recorded user is actually you. | The "created by" stamp on a job→invoice and its activity-log entry can be set to someone else. | ⚠️ **Codex rates this HIGH**, Claude rated it MEDIUM — surfaced both. Already has a parked strict-actor fix on the `feat/as-applied-invoices` branch (G3) — coordinate so it's fixed once, not twice. |
| B | **Two invoice-creating paths don't write a row to the money audit log** (`create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery`, the `complete_delivery` auto-invoice). | Your append-only financial ledger would be missing those invoices for an auditor. | Both are latent (rarely/never hit in prod). Same gap nightly-debug already closed on two sibling paths — just two more. |
| C | **Bulk "apply prepayments" can double-spend a customer's prepaid balance.** The bulk buttons decrement the cached balance but don't write the prepay-applied ledger rows, so a later reconcile can re-create the spent balance. | Real money correctness — a customer's prepaid credit could come back after being used. | Needs live-reachability check first; route the bulk path through the same ledger the single-apply path uses. |
| D | **A partially-voided payment can leave an invoice stuck showing "paid."** | The invoice's status wouldn't match its real balance. | Derive status from the balance after the void. |
| E | 6 more LOW items | per-penny rounding drift in the (dormant) field-billing split, stale job totals after loading a recipe, a blend-ticket that's manually marked prepaid/no-charge could be billed twice, a duplicate-line oversell guard, and a job-invoice audit-log row. | All low blast-radius; details in `LEDGER.json`. |

> One green item (field-application invoices being editable through the generic invoice screen) is a
> **frontend** fix but I **parked it on purpose** — that exact area is being reworked on
> `feat/as-applied-invoices`, so fixing it here would collide at merge.

### Parked — added in Cycle 2 (deeper dive on invoices + job-to-billing; all need a migration)

Each was independently confirmed by Codex (REAL) at the severity shown. All are **latent** — the
billing engine is still operationally near-empty, so none is corrupting live data today; they're
traps that would bite once invoices/jobs start flowing. Worst-first.

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| F | **Editing a field-application invoice doesn't "lock" it, so two people acting at the same instant can clash.** If one person edits the invoice's lines while another posts it in the same split-second, you can end up with a *posted* invoice whose line items were rewritten afterward — its total no longer matching the money audit log. | Every other invoice action locks the row first; this one edit path doesn't. Could produce a posted invoice that disagrees with the permanent ledger. | MEDIUM |
| G | **Two invoice paths don't refresh the stored "total cost" after an edit/creation** (`save_invoice` after a line edit; `create_invoice_from_order`). The stored cost stays at 0 / stale while the line items have real costs. | Today every report recomputes cost from the line items, so nothing visible is wrong — but any future report that trusts the stored number would understate cost / overstate margin. Best fixed as **one** small migration. | LOW |
| H | **Dropping a customer from a field-app invoice group cancels their invoice but writes no money-audit row.** | The append-only financial ledger would show the invoice being created but never cancelled — an auditor sees a dangling entry. Same gap class already closed elsewhere. | LOW |

> Also re-confirmed (already on your parked list from Cycle 1, not new): the `transfer_job_to_invoice`
> "who-did-it" forgery item — Cycle 2's check rated it **MEDIUM** (Cycle 1's Codex had said HIGH; both
> kept on record) — plus the job→invoice split-rounding item, now with a clearer fix (the header total
> isn't reconciled to the per-customer shares at all on the no-override path), and the missing
> job→invoice audit-log row. No new action — they're already in `LEDGER.json`.

## 🔎 Cycle log

### Cycle 1 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1 (all 7 billing subsystems) — PROOF run
- **Found:** 12 confirmed (0 BLOCKER / 0 HIGH / 5 MEDIUM / 7 LOW), 4 refuted as false positives.
- **Codex finding-gate:** confirmed the 3 acted-on findings REAL; **disagreed up** on the actor bug (MED→HIGH).
- **Fixed (green):** 1 — cancelled-commissions leak (committed `6ded5ce`, both Codex gates passed).
- **Parked (yellow):** 11 — all need a migration; documented above + in `LEDGER.json`.
- **Proven:** the full chain — hunt → Codex confirms finding → fix → Codex reviews fix → tests → commit-to-branch — works end-to-end. Nothing pushed; nothing touched live.

### Cycle 2 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1 focused: `invoices-core` + `jobs-to-billing` (hottest cluster)
- **Found:** 7 confirmed (0 BLOCKER / 0 HIGH / 3 MEDIUM / 4 LOW), 0 refuted, **0 green** (every fix needs a migration).
- **Dedupe:** 3 of the 7 were re-confirmations of already-parked Cycle-1 items (job→invoice actor-forgery, job→invoice share-rounding, job→invoice missing audit row) — enriched, not re-parked. **4 were new.**
- **Codex finding-gate:** independently confirmed **all 4 new findings REAL**, severities **matching** Claude's verifier exactly (1 MEDIUM + 3 LOW) — no disagreements this cycle.
- **Fixed (green):** 0 — nothing was committable (all migration-class).
- **Parked (yellow):** 4 new (items F–H above) + the 3 enriched re-confirmations.
- **Note:** `invoices-core` + `jobs-to-billing` still surfaced new findings, so they're **not drained** yet — they need one quiet cycle before being marked done. Recurring pattern flagged: several RPCs don't keep their stored derived totals in sync — worth one consolidating migration.

### Cycle 3 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: `field-app-invoices` — **DRY (nothing new)**
- **Found:** 1 confirmed (MEDIUM), 0 refuted — but on dedupe it was the **same issue already on your parked list** (field-application invoices opening in the generic invoice editor, which corrupts their structure on Save). So **0 new findings** this cycle.
- **Codex gate:** not run — there was no new finding to confirm and nothing to fix, so there was no change for Codex to gate (it only gates new candidates/diffs).
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 0 new — I enriched the existing parked item with more detail instead of double-listing it.
- **Why I left it alone:** this is the green/frontend item I deliberately parked in Cycle 1 — that whole area is being rebuilt on the `feat/as-applied-invoices` branch, so a fix here would clash at merge. Cycle 3 also surfaced a subtlety that *confirms* parking is right: a blanket "send all field-app invoices to the field-app editor" fix would be **partly wrong** (blend-ticket-backed ones are *supposed* to use the generic editor) — so the correct fix is the more careful one the feature branch is already building. It's also harmless today: there are **0 field-application invoices live**.
- **Take-away:** the `field-app-invoices` area looks **tapped out** for new signal — its one open defect is parked pending the feature-branch rework. Counts as the **1st dry cycle** (3 in a row stops the hunt). Next cycle moves to a **fresh** area: commissions + deliveries-billing.

### Cycle 4 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: `commissions` + `deliveries-billing`
- **Found:** 3 confirmed (0 BLOCKER / 0 HIGH / 1 MEDIUM / 2 LOW), **1 refuted** as a false positive. After dedupe: **2 new** (1 was a re-confirm of a Cycle-1 parked item), **0 green** (both new ones need a migration).
- **Codex finding-gate:** independently confirmed **both new findings REAL**, severities **matching** mine (1 MEDIUM + 1 LOW), and settled a tricky dedupe question on the first one (see note) — *and* caught a mistake in my proposed fix, which I've recorded so the eventual migration is correct.
- **Fixed (green):** 0 — nothing committable (both migration-class). **Parked (yellow):** 2 new (items I & J below).
- **Re-confirmed (already on your list):** the quick-delivery "same product listed twice could oversell" item from Cycle 1 — enriched, not re-listed.
- **Refuted (no action):** a commission-report item that *looks* wrong (the "Total Earned" column doesn't filter out cancelled commissions) but **can't actually produce a wrong number today** — cancelling an order zeroes the commission in the same step, so there's nothing to mis-count. Logged as a false positive.

### Parked — added in Cycle 4 (need a migration; all latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | **A partial delivery on an already-drafted invoice fixes the *price* but not the *cost*.** When you deliver only part of an order that already has a draft invoice, the invoice's revenue drops to what was actually delivered — but its recorded **cost stays at the full ordered amount**. | The invoice's profit/margin would read too low (cost overstated). It feeds month-end margin/COGS numbers and is never corrected later. **Codex flagged that the right field to fix is the invoice's stored total cost** (the per-item cost is per-unit, so it shouldn't be re-multiplied) — noted for the migration. | MEDIUM |
| J | **Editing an order can leave a multi-person commission split a penny off.** When commissions are first created, the last person's share is adjusted so the parts add up exactly to the order's profit. The *edit* path doesn't do that final adjustment, so after an edit an uneven or 3-way split can be off by a cent. | The commission rows would no longer sum to the order's profit (off by ±1¢ per edit). **Harmless today** — every current split is either one person (100%) or an even 50/50, neither of which can drift. It only bites once you set up an uneven or 3-way split *and* then edit that order. | LOW |

> Both are **latent** — they can't produce a wrong number on today's live data; they're traps that activate once partial deliveries / uneven commission splits actually happen. The fix for both is a database migration, so by your rule they wait for your OK.

### Cycle 5 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: `prepay-blend` + `splits-shares-allocation` — **richest cycle (2 HIGH)**
- **Found:** 5 confirmed (0 BLOCKER / **2 HIGH** / 1 MEDIUM / 2 LOW), **4 refuted** as false positives. After dedupe: **4 new** + **1 escalated re-confirm**; **0 green** (every fix needs a migration).
- **Codex finding-gate:** ran in 2 batches; Codex independently confirmed **all 5 real**. On one of the HIGHs (the blend-ticket one) Codex rated it **HIGH** while my own checker rated it MEDIUM-because-dormant — I've kept **both opinions** for you rather than picking one.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 4 new (items K–N below) + 1 escalation (item K-prepay).
- **Learning capture:** because there were 2 HIGHs, I wrote down the exact money-rules they break into `docs/reference/gotchas.md`, so whoever writes the fix can't reintroduce the bug. (Test comes with the fix.)
- **Nothing was pushed or touched live.** Everything is dormant today (the prepay & blend-ticket features have ~0 live data), so none of this is corrupting anything right now — but these are the most serious traps the hunt has found.

### Parked — added in Cycle 5 (need a migration; all dormant today, but 2 are HIGH)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| K | **Prepayments: the "apply all" / bulk buttons can let the same prepaid dollars get spent twice.** When you bulk-apply prepayments, the code lowers the customer's overall prepaid *balance* but never records *which credit paid which invoice* — so each individual credit still shows its full balance, and those same dollars can be applied again through the normal one-at-a-time button. | Real money double-spend on a shipped page. **This is the Cycle-1 item I previously rated MEDIUM — I've now raised it to HIGH** because I confirmed the buttons are live and the path is fully reachable. Latent only because no prepayments exist on live yet. | **HIGH** ⬆ |
| L | **A blend ticket split across several customers can get billed twice if one of its invoices is voided.** Voiding *one* customer's invoice flips the *whole* ticket back to "unbilled," so the system will happily generate a *second* full set of invoices for *every* customer on that ticket. | Double-billing every customer on a multi-customer blend ticket. **Codex rates this HIGH; my checker said MEDIUM (because no blend tickets exist live yet) — both noted.** Activates the first time a multi-customer ticket is billed. | **HIGH / MED** |
| M | **A fully-prepaid invoice stays marked "posted" instead of "paid."** The bulk-prepay path zeroes the invoice's balance but never advances its status, so any list/report that keys off "paid vs posted" would show it as still open. (The actual balance is correct — only the status label is wrong.) | Mislabels settled invoices as open in status-based views. Latent (no prepay-settled invoices live). | MEDIUM |
| N | **Two low-risk split/rounding items.** (1) A dead, unused "edit allocation set" function saves billing splits with no "must add up to 100%" check — best **retired** (deleted) since nothing calls it. (2) Field-application acre splitting rounds each owner's acres independently, so a 3-way split can be off by a hundredth of an acre (doesn't over/under-bill anyone — each owner is billed their own real acres — but the per-field acre totals won't tie out exactly for year-end reporting). | Both dormant; both small. The acre one folds into the field-app rework already happening on another branch. | LOW |

> **Refuted (no action) — 4 false alarms this cycle:** a prepay batch function that *looks* like it trusts a fake "who did it" value but the inner function re-checks the real user; an unused legacy prepay-credit function (already on your deferred list); an order-share percentage guard missing a lower bound (but that percentage doesn't actually feed any invoice); and a two-meanings-in-one-column allocation design that's only a risk if someone writes new code wrong (no such code exists). All logged as false positives in `LEDGER.json`.

### Cycle 6 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: re-checking `invoices` + `job-to-billing` (the two busiest areas) — **mostly old news**
- **Found:** 7 confirmed, 0 false alarms — but after de-duplicating, **6 of the 7 were the same issues already on your list** from Cycle 1 (the job→invoice function's known problems), each just re-discovered by two different review agents. Only **1 was new.**
- **The 1 new one (LOW):** when you turn a completed job into an invoice, the invoice's header total is taken from the *stored job total* rather than re-added from the invoice's own line items — so if that stored total were ever out of date, the header wouldn't match the lines. In practice the screen re-calculates the total on every save, so this is only reachable by a hand-crafted direct database call, and it's dormant (no jobs have been invoiced yet). Codex confirmed it's real and distinct from the related Cycle-1 item. Parked (needs a migration).
- **What this tells us:** the job→invoice function (`transfer_job_to_invoice`) is the single busiest trouble spot — it alone carries **four** of the recurring bug types (forgeable "who did it", missing audit-log row, header-not-from-lines, split shares that don't add up). I bundled all four into one plain-English fix-list in `gotchas.md` so they can be fixed together in one migration (and there's already a partial fix waiting on your other branch — they should be coordinated). 
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 new + the 3 known job→invoice items got more detail. Nothing pushed or touched live.
- **Drain status:** these two areas have now been hunted 3×; the rate of *new* findings is dropping fast (lots → 4 → 1), so one more quiet pass should let me mark them "done."

### Cycle 7 — 2026-06-19 — Phase 1: re-checking commissions + deliveries — **clean (0 new), 2 areas now "done"**
- **Found:** nothing new. The 2 issues that surfaced were both **already on your list** (the delivery auto-invoices missing an audit-log entry; the commission penny-rounding on order edits), just re-discovered.
- **One useful correction:** an issue I'd parked in Cycle 4 as a **MEDIUM** ("partial deliveries leave the invoice's cost stale → wrong month-end margin") turned out to be **overstated**. On a closer look at the actual month-end report code, the month-end totals are *recomputed from the line items* (not from the stale stored number), and only *posted* invoices count — so month-end margin is **not** affected. The only real leftover is a cosmetic cost figure on a single draft-invoice screen. **I downgraded that item from MEDIUM to LOW** to reflect the true (much smaller) impact. Net: your list is slightly *less* scary than before, not more.
- **One reassuring detail:** I confirmed the "missing audit-log row" issue is real on actual data — all 4 invoices currently in the system were created by the delivery path and none has its creation logged in the money ledger. It's still draft-stage only (the *posting* step is logged), so it stays MEDIUM, but it's now proven rather than theoretical. The fix bundles both delivery-invoice functions into one migration.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 0 new (existing items enriched / one re-scoped down). Nothing pushed or touched live.
- **Drain status:** commissions + deliveries-billing are now marked **DONE** (two passes, no new issues). That's **1 of the 3 quiet cycles** needed before the whole hunt auto-stops. Several Phase-1 areas have one more confirming pass to go, then I move to the broad whole-app sweep (Phase 2).

### Cycle 8 — 2026-06-19 — MERGE / two-loops reconciliation — **caught a HIGH the other run missed**
- **What happened:** for a stretch tonight, **two copies of this hunt were running at once.** A one-time scheduled task fired at 6:00 PM and started a second loop alongside the interactive session. We sorted it out — the scheduled task is now off and the second run stopped — and this session is the single driver again. (No harm done: both loops are read-only and only ever *park* database fixes; nothing can reach production.)
- **The important catch:** while the two were overlapping, **this session** ran its own `commissions` + `deliveries-billing` hunt and found a **HIGH** that the *other* run's commission pass **missed entirely**. So when I merged the two, I made sure it got captured (it otherwise would have been lost). **Codex independently confirmed it REAL/HIGH.**
- **Result:** **1 new HIGH parked** (item **O** below). Because a real HIGH slipped past both earlier commission passes, I've **re-opened `commissions`** from "done" — it needs one more proper hunt before it can be called drained again. Everything else my session touched (the delivery cost item + the prepay/blend HIGHs) was already captured by Cycles 4/5/7, so nothing else was lost in the merge.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 8 (need a migration; latent today, but HIGH)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| O | **Cancelling or voiding an order can later pay out a commission that was already cancelled.** If a salesperson's commission is queued into a payout batch and then that order is cancelled/voided, the cancel correctly zeroes the commission — but when you later *post* the payout batch, the system flips that cancelled commission **back to "paid"** and pays the **old amount**, for an order that no longer exists. | Real wrong-money: you'd pay a commission on a cancelled sale, and the records would show a "paid" commission tied to a dead order. **The exact safeguard already exists on a sibling code path** (the order-edit path was fixed this way) — it just needs copying onto the cancel/void paths. Harmless today (no real payout batches exist yet); fires on the first real commission payout where this sequence happens. | **HIGH** |

> Why this matters beyond the one bug: it's a reminder that the automated hunt isn't perfect — its search is a bit random, and **both** earlier commission passes happened to miss this angle. Running a second, independent pass (which is exactly what the overlap accidentally produced) is what caught it. I've re-opened commissions so it gets that fresh pass on purpose.

### Cycle 9 — 2026-06-19 — sole driver: fresh `commissions` pass + 2nd `prepay` pass
- **Found:** 2 confirmed (1 HIGH + 1 MEDIUM), 0 false alarms, 0 green.
- **The commission HIGH got *worse* (in a useful way):** the fresh pass re-found yesterday's commission bug **and discovered a third place it happens** — cancelling a *delivery* (not just an order) hits the same flaw. So the eventual fix needs to cover all three cancel paths (cancel order, void order, cancel delivery). Good thing I re-opened it — the earlier "done" had missed both the bug and this extra path.
- **One new issue (item P below):** a prepayment can be applied **across customers** — the "apply a prepaid credit to an invoice" function never checks that the credit and the invoice belong to the *same* customer. The normal screen only ever shows you one customer's credits and invoices, so you can't do this by accident — but someone calling the function directly (or a bad bulk payload) could pay down **Customer B's** invoice using **Customer A's** prepaid money. Codex rated this **HIGH**; my own checker rated it **MEDIUM** (because it needs a deliberate non-screen action and there's no prepayment data live yet) — I've kept **both opinions**. Latent today.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 new (item P). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 9 (need a migration; latent today)

| P | **A prepaid credit can be applied to a *different customer's* invoice.** The function that applies a prepayment to an invoice never confirms the credit and the invoice belong to the same customer. | Wrong-account money: Customer A's prepaid balance could pay down Customer B's invoice, and both customers' prepaid balances would be left wrong. Can't happen from the normal screen (it's scoped to one customer), only via a direct/bulk function call. One-line guard fixes it. | **HIGH (Codex) / MED (Claude)** |

### Cycle 10 — 2026-06-19 — sole driver: 2nd pass on split-invoices/allocations + field-application invoices — **quiet (0 new), 1 area now "done"**
- **Found:** nothing new. All 4 issues that surfaced were **already on your list** — the field-application-invoice editing problem and three known problems with the job→invoice function (forgeable "who did it", missing audit-log row, penny-rounding on splits). The job→invoice function remains the single busiest trouble spot (it alone carries 4 recurring bug types).
- **One genuinely useful upgrade** to the field-application-invoice item (item, from Cycle 1): I'd parked it as "wait for the feature-branch rework," but this pass found a **much simpler fix that works now** — a one-line server guard that blocks the generic invoice editor from ever touching a field-application invoice (it currently can not only scramble the invoice's structure but even **change its type** from field-application to chemical-sale). I re-rated this item **HIGH** and noted the server-guard option so you don't have to wait on the bigger rework to close it. Still harmless today (no field-application invoices exist live).
- **Learning capture:** since this was a quiet cycle, I used it to write down the exact money-rules behind the two newest HIGHs (the commission-payout one and the cross-customer prepay one) into `gotchas.md`, so whoever writes those fixes can't reintroduce the bug.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 0 new (existing items enriched). Nothing pushed or touched live.
- **Drain status:** `field-application invoices` is now marked **DONE** (two quiet passes). That's the **2nd of the 3 quiet cycles** that would auto-stop the hunt. Remaining Phase-1 areas need one more confirming pass each, then the broad whole-app sweep (Phase 2).

### Cycle 11 — 2026-06-19 — sole driver: prepay/blend (3rd pass) + split-invoices (3rd pass) — **caught a wrong "all-clear"**
- **The headline — I double-checked one of your HIGHs and it held up.** One of the review agents this cycle tried to *clear* the **multi-customer blend-ticket double-billing** issue (item L on your list), arguing "a blend ticket only ever has one customer, so there's nothing to double-bill." That sounded important, so I **read the actual function** rather than take its word — and the all-clear was **wrong**. A blend ticket's customers come from **who owns the fields** on the ticket (a field can be co-owned), not from a single customer field, and the code explicitly creates **one invoice per owning customer**. So the double-billing risk is **real and stays on your list**. (This is exactly the kind of thing the independent-second-look process is for — it stopped a real issue from being wrongly dismissed.)
- **One genuinely new issue (LOW, item Q):** the newer "field/acre allocations" on an order aren't **locked after the order is invoiced**, the way the older "bill split" records already are. It can't cause a wrong charge today (a guard blocks re-billing while invoices are active) — the only effect is that if you void the invoices, edit the allocations, and re-bill, the new invoices would reflect the edited split. A small consistency fix (add the same lock the sibling table already has).
- **One non-issue:** a sub-penny acre-rounding question on field splits was re-examined and confirmed **not** a real money problem (each customer is billed their own real acres — there's no shared total to missplit). Kept on the list at the very bottom as a "nice-to-have," safe to drop.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 new (item Q). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 11 (need a migration; latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q | **Order field/acre allocations aren't locked after invoicing.** The older "bill split" records get frozen once an order is invoiced; the newer field/acre allocation records don't. | Low risk: a re-bill guard already prevents a live double-charge. The only gap is that voiding the invoices, editing the allocations, then re-billing would bill the *edited* split instead of what was originally billed (a records/audit mismatch). One-line-equivalent: add the same lock the sibling table already has. | LOW |

### Cycle 12 — 2026-06-19 — sole driver: confirming pass on invoices + job→invoice — **1 new (finance charges)**
- **Found:** 5 confirmed — but after de-duplicating, **4 were already on your list** (the job→invoice function's four known quirks) and **1 was genuinely new.**
- **The new one (MEDIUM, item R):** the **finance-charge "preview" and the actual "generate" don't count the same invoices.** When you review late-fee charges before applying them, the *preview* leaves out invoices already marked "overdue" and ignores the grace-period offset — but the real *generate* step includes them. So the number you approve in the preview can be **lower than what actually gets billed** to a customer. It can't surprise a customer who wasn't on the preview at all (the screen only generates for customers it showed you), but for a customer who *is* shown, the billed amount can differ from the previewed one. Harmless today (no late fees or overdue invoices exist live). Codex agreed it's real and MEDIUM. Fix: make the preview and the generate use the exact same rule (ideally one shared definition so they can't drift apart again).
- **One half-claim I threw out:** an agent suggested the generic invoice editor should write to the money audit ledger on every draft edit — but that's **not** a bug (the ledger is for posted/voided money events, and draft edits aren't money events yet). Correctly logged as a non-issue.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 new (item R). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 12 (need a migration; latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| R | **The late-fee preview and the actual late-fee run count different invoices.** The preview skips already-"overdue" invoices and ignores the grace period; the real run includes them. | The late-fee amount you approve in the preview can be **less than what's actually billed** to a customer who appears in the preview. Can't bill a customer the preview didn't show at all. Harmless today (no overdue invoices / late fees live). Fix: make preview and generate share one identical rule. | MEDIUM |

### Cycle 13 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: final prepay/blend + split pass — **1 new, billing engine wrapped**
- **One new issue (MEDIUM, item S):** if you **delete a draft blend-ticket invoice**, the blend ticket gets **stuck as "billed" with no invoice** — and then it can never be billed again (you'd need a developer to fix it in the database). It's the mirror image of the multi-customer blend bug already on your list. Harmless today (no blend tickets live). Codex confirmed it; fix is to reset the ticket when its invoice is deleted.
- **Good news on a HIGH:** a fresh review independently **re-confirmed** the multi-customer blend double-billing issue is real (the same one a faulty review tried to dismiss last cycle) — so it's solidly on your list, no doubt about it.
- **Three false alarms, all correctly dismissed** (I checked each — a known unused function, a misread on an allocation function that's actually fine, and a "what if a future caller misuses it" that no current code does).
- **Milestone — the billing engine is now thoroughly checked.** 13 cycles, every billing subsystem hunted; the serious money issues were all found early and are on your list. **From here the hunt moves to the rest of the app** (security/permissions, data-type drift, frontend safety, edge functions, etc.) — fresh ground that hasn't been examined yet.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 new (item S). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 13 (need a migration; latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| S | **Deleting a draft blend-ticket invoice strands the ticket as "billed" forever.** Deleting the invoice doesn't reset the ticket's billing status, so it stays "billed" with no actual invoice — and the system then refuses to bill it again. | You'd lose the ability to bill that blend ticket without a developer fixing the database by hand. Harmless today (no blend tickets live). Fix bundles with the related blend-ticket fix already on your list. | MEDIUM |

### Cycle 14 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: **first whole-app (non-billing) cycle** — security + frontend safety
- **Found:** 2 small issues (both LOW) + 1 false alarm (correctly dismissed). This was the first pass over the *rest* of the app now that the billing engine is wrapped.
- **Item T (LOW, security):** one blend-ticket function lets a caller fake "who did it" on a status-change log entry (the same fix already applied to its two sibling functions just wasn't applied to this one). Low impact — it only affects an activity log (not the money ledger), there's no screen that calls it, and there's no blend-ticket data live. Codex rated it slightly higher (medium); I've kept both views. Needs a database fix → parked.
- **Item U (LOW, safety-net):** the app has a strong automatic safety net for one kind of database call but **not** the matching net for database *writes* — so a future write written a certain sloppy way could silently report "success" even when permissions blocked it. **Every current write is correctly written**, so nothing is wrong today; this is about preventing a future mistake.
  - **Why I didn't auto-fix this one:** it's the kind of thing I normally *can* safely fix on my own (it's just a test). But the obvious quick version would be **wrong** — it would falsely flag dozens of correct files. Doing it right needs a more careful approach, and that's a change to the whole team's automated checks, so it shouldn't be rushed in unattended at 1 AM. Codex agreed. I've parked it with the exact correct approach written down, to do properly later.
- **The false alarm:** a function that *looked* like it skipped a permission check, but the check is actually enforced (and any violation is fully rolled back) by the function it calls. No bug.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 2 (items T & U). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 14 (latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| T | **A blend-ticket status function lets the caller fake "who did it."** The same actor-check already on its sibling functions wasn't applied here. | Affects only the activity log (not the money ledger), has no screen that calls it, and no blend data exists live — so very low impact. Needs a one-line database fix. | LOW |
| U | **Missing automatic safety net for database writes.** There's a strong auto-check for one type of call but not the matching one for writes; a future sloppy write could falsely show "success" on a blocked permission. | Nothing wrong today (all current writes are correct) — it's a "prevent a future mistake" guardrail. I parked the correct approach to add it carefully (the quick version would mis-flag good code). | LOW |

### Cycle 15 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: lifecycle rules + the edge functions
- **The reassuring headline:** I checked the **6 background services** (the email sender, file/document upload, user-creation, password reset, blend-ticket processing) and the **customer PDFs** — for permission checks, login enforcement, admin-only gating, and duplicate protection — and found **nothing wrong**. That's a real attack surface, and it came back clean.
- **One new small issue (LOW, item V):** the database doesn't stop a *job* from being cancelled out of any state (e.g. cancelling an already-invoiced job) — only the screen prevents it. The matching rule *is* enforced in the database for orders and deliveries; jobs just missed it. Can't happen through the app today, and there are no completed/invoiced jobs live — it's a "tighten the rule at the database level" defense fix. Codex confirmed; needs a database fix → parked.
- **Two known job→invoice items resurfaced** (the "who did it" forgery and the missing audit-log row) — already on your list, not new.
- **One doc note (not a bug):** the written order-lifecycle summary implies a "cancelled → voided" step that the code correctly doesn't allow. The code is right; the doc summary is just compressed. I left it alone (it's a core file and a borderline wording nit) — flagging in case you want it clarified.
- **Fixed (green):** 0. **Parked (yellow):** 1 (item V). Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Parked — added in Cycle 15 (latent today)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| V | **A job can be cancelled from any state at the database level** (e.g. an already-invoiced job), with only the screen stopping it. | The matching guard already exists for orders and deliveries; jobs missed it. Can't happen through the app, and no completed/invoiced jobs exist live — it's a defense fix to enforce the rule in the database too. | LOW |

### Cycle 16 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: code-vs-database consistency — **all clean (nothing new)**
- **A clean, reassuring result.** This cycle checked the category that caused **40+ bugs back in spring** — where the database functions or the code's data definitions drift out of sync with the real database. It came back **clean**:
  - Every one of the **209 database functions and 48 automatic triggers** passed an automated correctness check with **zero errors**.
  - No duplicate/conflicting function definitions, no functions writing to columns that don't exist, and the duplicate-protection plumbing is all correct.
  - The code's data definitions match the live database (a few spots where the code is slightly *looser* than the database — saying a value is always present when it can occasionally be empty — but every one of those is already safely handled, so nothing can break).
- **Found:** 0 new issues. **Fixed:** 0. **Parked:** 0. Nothing pushed or touched live.
- This is the **1st of 3 consecutive quiet cycles** that would end the hunt. One area left to check first (project docs/dependencies/test gaps), then a couple of confirming passes.

### Cycle 17 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: project docs / dependencies / tests (+ 2nd edge-function pass)
- **One tiny new item (LOW, item W):** a documentation count is stale — the docs say there are 47 automatic database triggers, but there are now **49** (2 were added recently). Purely cosmetic — nothing runs differently — but I parked it rather than auto-fix it, because the count lives in a few places including the main instructions file and an auto-generated file, so it's cleaner to update them all together properly (a routine "sync the docs" task) than to hand-edit one spot at 4 AM.
- **The edge functions passed a 2nd clean check** — that whole area (email, uploads, admin services, PDFs) is now marked fully checked.
- **A few things looked concerning but checked out fine** (all dismissed after verification):
  - A flagged security advisory in a PDF library — but the vulnerable part is **never used** (we build PDFs a different way), so it can't be exploited.
  - The full end-to-end test suite doesn't run automatically in the build pipeline — **but** that's a known, deliberate setup (it can't safely run against the live site, and the heavy financial tests weren't in the automated set anyway). Flagging for your awareness, not as a bug.
- **Found:** 1 cosmetic doc item. **Fixed:** 0. **Parked:** 1 (item W). Nothing pushed or touched live.
- **The whole app has now been swept** — billing engine + security, permissions, lifecycle rules, edge functions, type/schema consistency, docs/dependencies/tests. From here it's a couple of confirming passes to wrap up.

### Parked — added in Cycle 17 (cosmetic)

| # | Plain-English issue | Why it matters | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| W | **A documentation count is out of date** (says 47 database triggers, there are 49). | Purely cosmetic — nothing behaves differently. Best fixed by the routine "sync the docs" task so all the places that mention the count update together. | LOW |

### Cycle 18 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: 2nd pass on security + frontend safety — **clean (nothing new)**
- **Found:** nothing new. The one item that surfaced was **already on your list** (the blend-ticket "who did it" function from cycle 14) — re-checked, still real, still parked. The frontend-safety re-check came back empty.
- These two areas (security/permissions and frontend write-safety) are now **confirmed checked twice** with no new issues.
- **This is the 1st of the 3 consecutive quiet cycles** that wrap up the hunt. **Found:** 0 new. **Fixed:** 0. Nothing pushed or touched live.

### Cycle 19 — 2026-06-20 — sole driver: **final cycle** — lifecycle + docs re-check, then stopped
- **No new bugs.** The 3 things that surfaced were all already known: the "a job can be cancelled from any state" item (re-checked — I **raised it from low to medium** because on a closer look it could orphan an already-created invoice if a completed/invoiced job were cancelled by a direct database call), plus two cosmetic documentation count fixes (a couple of "47 vs 49"/"226 vs 227" tallies that drifted). Three more false alarms were dismissed.
- **Decision to stop here:** the whole app has now been swept, and the last four cycles found **zero meaningful new bugs** — just clean results, cosmetic count fixes, and re-confirmations. That's the signal that the hunt has done its job, so I **stopped it cleanly** (about 2 hours before the morning cutoff) rather than keep spinning cycles on cosmetic items. You can restart it anytime by saying "start the overnight bug hunt."
- **Found:** 0 new bugs. **Fixed:** 0. Nothing pushed or touched live. **Loop ended.**

### Cycle 20 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped `jobs-to-billing` confirming pass — **clean**
- **Graph proof:** refreshed at commit `b31c9f27`; 6,644 nodes / 14,145 links, including 1,985 migration nodes and 140 Edge Function nodes. Exact queries: `graphify explain "JobDetail" --budget 1200`, `graphify affected "JobDetail" --depth 2 --budget 1200`, and `graphify query "job recipe application billing handoff excluding invoice inventory delivery receiving" --budget 1200`.
- **Source proof:** narrowed inspection to `src/pages/JobDetail.tsx`, `src/pages/Jobs.tsx`, and `src/lib/recipeHelpers.ts`, including save/start/complete/cancel callers, recipe load/save, loader-worksheet persistence, application notifications, and the transfer handoff boundary. RPC and mutation results on the inspected paths are checked; the post-save override-audit non-atomicity is explicitly documented as an accepted owner tradeoff.
- **Dedupe and ownership proof:** the direct job-cancellation lifecycle gap and job-transfer actor/audit/rounding/header items already exist in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` / this ledger. Invoice creation/save, inventory deduction/holds, delivery/receiving, PO/AP, prepayment, and transaction-ledger leads were deferred to active owner task `019f67f6-8536-7b53-9487-319972813b50`; none were edited or re-proposed.
- **Verdict:** 0 new confirmed findings, 0 fixes, 0 parked items. This is the second consecutive dry `jobs-to-billing` pass, so that key is now formally drained. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.

### Cycle 21 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped field-application navigation — **1 fixed green**
- **Graph proof:** refreshed at commit `b31c9f27`; exact query `graphify explain "FieldApplicationInvoice()" --budget 1200` narrowed the lane to the field-application editor and its shared navigation guard. The matching `affected` query returned no useful dependents because the symbol is ambiguous, so current-source imports and route references were used to verify the edge.
- **Confirmed bug:** `FieldApplicationInvoice.tsx` called `useUnsavedChanges(dirty)` but discarded the returned router blocker and rendered no `UnsavedChangesModal`. A dirty in-app navigation was therefore blocked with no visible Stay/Leave choice.
- **Scope boundary:** this fix only wires the existing navigation blocker to the shared modal. It does not change field-application save behavior, invoice typing, RPC calls, database logic, or any file owned by task `019f67f6-8536-7b53-9487-319972813b50`.
- **Adversarial proof:** independent GPT-5.5 review confirmed the finding before the edit and returned `CLEAN` after it. Focused test execution passed 22/22, TypeScript passed, and targeted ESLint passed. The regression renders the real shared modal and proves both Stay/reset and Leave/proceed actions.
- **Verdict:** dedupe key `frontend:field-application-invoice:unsaved-navigation-dead-end` is `FIXED_GREEN`. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.

### Cycle 22 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped frontend safety — **clean**
- **Graph proof:** refreshed at commit `8e7b5aef`; 6,644 nodes / 14,147 links. Exact queries: `graphify explain "checkMutationResult" --budget 1200`, `graphify affected "checkMutationResult" --depth 2 --budget 1200`, and `graphify query "frontend mutations that can report success when database writes fail excluding delivery receiving purchase order AP invoice prepayment inventory transaction ledger" --budget 1200`. The shared checker has 104 direct graph connections.
- **Source proof:** the full frontend validator reported no missing update/delete result checks. Narrow inspection of non-owned insert/upsert candidates confirmed they inspect and handle returned errors. A complete `useUnsavedChanges` call-site check confirmed every current consumer now renders `UnsavedChangesModal`; the Cycle-21 omission was the only gap.
- **Dedupe and ownership proof:** the known future insert/upsert coverage gate remains parked as item U. Money/inventory/delivery/receiving/PO/AP/prepayment and transaction-ledger files owned by task `019f67f6-8536-7b53-9487-319972813b50` were excluded.
- **Verdict:** 0 new confirmed findings, 0 fixes, 0 parked items. Frontend safety remains drained. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.

### Cycle 23 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped lifecycle invariants — **clean**
- **Graph proof:** graph build commit `8e7b5aef`; exact queries: `graphify explain "cancel_job" --budget 1200`, `graphify affected "cancel_job" --depth 3 --budget 1200`, and `graphify query "lifecycle transitions and terminal state guards for jobs quotes returns commissions scheduling excluding delivery receiving purchase orders invoices prepayments inventory" --budget 1600`. Graphify had no unique `cancel_job` symbol, so the semantic query plus current migration/function definitions narrowed the source surface.
- **Source proof:** current migration `20260620150000_job_cancel_gate.sql` gates job cancellation to scheduled/in-progress states; `20260715115155_harden_return_lifecycle_updates.sql` makes return lifecycle fields RPC-owned; quote terminal and commission payout guards are present in current migrations. Six focused suites passed 143/143 across job saves/mass edits, quote calculations, return write boundaries, and commission payout/split guards.
- **Live read-only proof:** the authoritative live `_enforce_job_status_transition()` body contains the scheduled/in-progress source gate, `trg_return_lifecycle_rpc_owned` exists, and `_enforce_quote_terminal_not_drawn()` exists. The historical `20260620150000` filename/version was not present in migration history under that exact identity, so no claim is made about its stamp; the live enforced behavior itself is confirmed current.
- **Ownership proof:** delivery, PO, invoice, prepayment, inventory, and all files owned by task `019f67f6-8536-7b53-9487-319972813b50` were excluded.
- **Verdict:** 0 new confirmed findings, 0 fixes, 0 parked items. Lifecycle invariants are drained. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.

### Cycle 24 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped Edge Functions and PDFs — **clean**
- **Graph proof:** graph build commit `8e7b5aef`; exact query `graphify query "Supabase Edge Functions authentication authorization CORS idempotency and customer PDF generation excluding delivery receiving invoice statement inventory PDFs" --budget 1800`. The broad result was narrowed to the seven current function entrypoints, shared auth/CORS helpers, and non-owned PDF generators/tests.
- **Source and live proof:** all seven deployed Edge Functions are active with `verify_jwt=true`. Current source validates the bearer token with `auth.getUser()`, uses the shared CORS helper, and applies role/resource gates where service-role access is used. Ten focused Edge/PDF suites passed 137/137.
- **Ownership proof:** Edge changes are park-only under the mission. Delivery, receiving, invoice/statement, inventory PDFs, `process-blend-ticket` business behavior, and every active-owner file/subsystem were excluded from finding work; only its existing guard test participated in read-only verification.
- **Verdict:** 0 new confirmed findings, 0 fixes, 0 parked items. Edge/PDF remains drained. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.

### Cycle 25 — 2026-07-15 restart — Graphify-scoped docs, dependencies, and test gaps — **clean**
- **Graph proof:** graph build commit `8e7b5aef`; exact query `graphify query "documentation drift dependency vulnerabilities untested workflows and skipped tests excluding migration-history rpc-functions money inventory delivery receiving purchase orders invoices prepayments" --budget 1800`. Current doc-check scripts, dependency verification, workflow tests, and non-owned coverage surfaces were inspected.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:docs` passed all local assertions; `npm run verify:deps` confirmed installed Vite/Vitest/plugin versions match the lockfile. `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reports 0 production vulnerabilities. The full audit has only two LOW development-tool advisories (`@babel/core` arbitrary source-map file read and `esbuild` local Windows dev-server file read), both with upstream fixes available and no production bundle exposure.
- **Test-gap disposition:** conditional E2E skips depend on staging credentials/data and the CI E2E job remains intentionally disabled until a non-production Supabase project exists. This is the already recorded environment posture, not a new runtime defect. Owned money/inventory/delivery/receiving/PO/invoice/prepayment test gaps were excluded.
- **Verdict:** 0 new confirmed findings, 0 fixes, 0 parked items. Docs/deps/tests is drained. Cycles 22–25 are four consecutive complete dry cycles, exceeding the mission's three-cycle stop bar. No push, deploy, live migration, or production mutation occurred.
