# Setting Up CRX Manager on a New Machine

This is the step-by-step bootstrap for getting CRX Manager + all Claude Code automation working on a fresh computer (e.g., the work laptop, a teammate's machine, or a clean reinstall).

**Audience:** Mason or anyone helping him. Assumes zero prior knowledge of the project.

**Time:** 30–45 minutes if everything goes smoothly.

---

## Step 1 — Install the base tools (one-time per machine)

You need three things installed on the machine before anything else works:

### 1a. Node.js (required for Claude Code hooks)
- Go to https://nodejs.org and download **Node.js 24** — the version the project pins in its `.nvmrc` file (CI uses the same file).
- Install with default options.
- Verify in a terminal:
  ```
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```
  Both should print version numbers.

### 1b. Git
- Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win — install with default options.
- Verify: `git --version`

### 1c. Claude Code
- Follow Anthropic's official install instructions: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup
- After install, sign in via `claude login` (or whatever the current command is).
- Verify Claude Code is working: open a terminal in any directory and type `claude` — should launch the interactive prompt.

### 1d. GitHub CLI (optional but recommended)
- https://cli.github.com — for `gh` commands the workflows use.
- After install: `gh auth login` to authenticate.

---

## Step 2 — Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/masonwells1/CRX_Manager_V1.0.git
cd CRX_Manager_V1.0
```

Or if you already cloned it before:

```
cd CRX_Manager_V1.0
git pull
```

---

## Step 3 — Install dependencies and activate Husky

```
npm install
```

This does two important things:
1. Downloads all the JavaScript/TypeScript packages the app needs.
2. Runs the `prepare` script (`scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs`), which points git at the tracked `.husky/` folder of hooks. Every `git commit` now runs the fast staged-file safety checks; typecheck/build run at pre-push, and the full lint/test/build proof runs in CI whenever its `ci-scope` job routes the pull request to full CI (docs-only changes skip it).

If `npm install` fails:
- Check your Node.js version (`node --version`) — it should be 24 (see `.nvmrc`).
- On Windows, sometimes a stale npm cache causes problems. Try `npm cache clean --force` then retry.

---

## Step 4 — Create the `.env` file (NEVER commit this)

The `.env` file holds secrets that must never be in the repo. It is gitignored.

Create a file named `.env` in the project root with these variables (copy from your home machine, or create new values where applicable):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rhyzpcqhnizqbxphqdkr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your anon key — same on every machine, safe to share within the team>
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=<your Mapbox token>
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=<your Sentry DSN>
```

⚠️ **The `service_role` key must NEVER be in `.env`.** Hosted Supabase injects it into Edge Functions automatically as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, so there is nothing to set (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`); never add it as a custom secret. The `env-guard` hook will block any attempt to put it in `src/`.

If you don't have these values, grab them from:
- Supabase URL + anon key: Supabase dashboard → Project settings → API
- Mapbox token: account.mapbox.com → Tokens
- Sentry DSN: sentry.io → Project → Settings → Client Keys

---

## Step 5 — Install Claude Code plugins

Claude Code plugins are NOT in the repo — they install at the user level. The CRX Manager workflow relies on several:

```
# Core review and dev workflow
claude plugins install pr-review-toolkit
claude plugins install feature-dev
claude plugins install code-review
claude plugins install coderabbit
claude plugins install commit-commands

# Engineering and observability
claude plugins install engineering
claude plugins install posthog
claude plugins install supabase
claude plugins install superpowers

# Misc useful
claude plugins install plugin-dev
claude plugins install claude-md-management
claude plugins install frontend-design
```

(Adjust the command syntax to match the current Claude Code plugin manager — check `claude plugins --help` if unsure.)

Verify all installed by opening Claude Code in the project directory and checking that the slash menu has entries like `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`, `/posthog:investigating-replay`, `/engineering:debug`, etc.

---

## Step 6 — Connect MCP servers

MCP server credentials are per-machine. The most important ones for CRX Manager:

### Supabase MCP
- Most important — gives Claude Code direct DB access for migrations, advisors, edge function deploys.
- In Claude Code: invoke whatever the current `add MCP server` flow is, choose Supabase.
- Authenticate with your Supabase project token (NOT the anon or service_role key — a personal access token from your Supabase account settings).
- Verify by asking Claude "list my Supabase projects" — it should call the MCP and return rhyzpcqhnizqbxphqdkr.

### Sentry MCP
- For error tracking + the posthog-style error analyzer.
- Authenticate with your Sentry organization auth.

### Vercel MCP
- Already wired in `.claude/settings.json` (`"vercel@claude-plugins-official": true`).
- First use will prompt for auth.

### PostHog MCP
- For session replay, error tracking, analytics queries.
- Auth flow on first use.

### GitHub MCP
- Optional — Claude usually uses the `gh` CLI directly.

### Computer Use / Claude in Chrome / etc.
- These are per-machine and only matter if you use them. Skip if not.

---

## Step 7 — Verify the automation works

In Claude Code (open in the CRX Manager directory):

### 7a. SessionStart hooks fire
Start a new session. You should immediately see (silently, in Claude's context):
- A git porcelain snapshot
- A staleness check report (schema-registry behind the migrations, uncommitted files from a prior session, a missing or stale weekly DB backup)

If Claude can describe what's in `git status` without you telling it, the hooks are working.

### 7b. Try a write that should be blocked
Ask Claude: "Create a file at `.env.test` with the content `FOO=bar`."

The `env-guard` PreToolUse hook should refuse.

### 7c. Run /preflight
Type `/preflight` or say "do a preflight check." It should:
- Detect what changed (nothing if you haven't edited anything yet)
- Skip subagent dispatch (no relevant changes)
- Run lint + typecheck + build + tests
- Print a verdict

If these checks work, the automation is fully active.

---

## Step 8 — (Optional) Sync memory from home machine

Memory files (Claude's persistent notes about you and the project) live at:

```
C:\Users\<your-username>\.claude\projects\<encoded-checkout-path>\memory\
```

The folder name is the checkout's full path with every character that is not a letter or digit turned into `-`. On Mason's
machine the checkout is `C:\CRX_Manager`, so the folder is `C--CRX-Manager`.

These are NOT in the repo. If you want your home machine's memory to follow you:

1. Copy the entire `memory/` folder from home to work (USB stick, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.).
2. Watch out for the path — the directory name encodes where the repo is checked out, so if you clone it to a different folder on the new machine, rename the copied folder to match.

If you skip this step, the work-computer Claude starts with a blank memory and rebuilds context over time as you use it. That's fine for most cases.

---

## Step 9 — First commit on the work machine

When you make your first change at work and commit, watch for:
- Husky pre-commit hook running (containment + staged safety checks) — proves Step 3 worked. Pre-push runs containment, typecheck, and build; CI provides the full lint/test/build product proof, including `check:docs`.
- Stop hook reminding you of loose ends — proves Step 7a worked.

If both fire, you are 100% set up.

---

## What you don't need to do

- ❌ Re-run any migration. The live Supabase DB is shared — both machines hit the same project.
- ❌ Re-deploy any Edge Function. Same — they're already live.
- ❌ Reconfigure CLAUDE.md, hooks, agents, skills — all in the repo, already pulled.
- ❌ Re-add the `supabase/migrations/` files — same, in repo.
- ❌ Set up deploys. Vercel is already connected: when a pull request merges into `main`, the live app updates automatically. (`main` is protected — you never push to it directly; changes land through a branch and a pull request.)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code says "no Skill tool" or doesn't see skills
- Make sure you ran `claude` from inside the `CRX_Manager_V1.0` directory (it auto-loads `.claude/` from the project root).
- Try restarting the Claude Code session.

### Hooks aren't firing
- Verify Node.js is on your PATH: `node --version` in a terminal.
- Check `.claude/settings.json` is unchanged from the repo (run `git diff .claude/settings.json` — should be empty).

### Husky pre-commit isn't running
- `npm install` may not have triggered the prepare script. Run `npm run prepare` manually.
- Run `git config core.hooksPath` — it should print `.husky`. The hooks live in the tracked `.husky/` folder, not in `.git/hooks/`.
- `npm run agent-health` reports the hook state in its `Git hooks installed` row.

### MCP server doesn't connect
- Check the auth token hasn't expired.
- Try `claude mcp list` to see connection status.
- Most MCPs have a re-auth flow via `claude mcp auth <server>`.

### Build fails on first run
- Usually a stale node_modules or missing peer dep. Try:
  ```
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm ci
  ```

### "I broke something and want to start fresh"
- Don't `git reset --hard` (bash-safety blocks it for good reason).
- Don't use a bare `git stash` / `git stash pop` either: the stash list is shared by every worktree and every Claude session on the machine, so `pop` can grab someone else's work.
- Instead: commit your changes to a temporary work-in-progress branch, then `git pull` on a clean checkout. If you must stash, use a named one (`git stash push -u -m "<unique name>"`), restore it with `git stash apply <its id>` rather than `pop`, and ask Claude to help find the right entry.

---

## Maintenance

These should run periodically on whichever machine you're working from:

- After any DB schema change: invoke `/regen-schema-registry` and commit the result.
- After any feature work: invoke `/preflight` before commit.
- Weekly: invoke `/audit` to catch drift between docs and code.
- Whenever Sentry shows new errors: invoke `/spot-check-prod` or `engineering:debug`.

---

## When you're stuck

Most things in CRX Manager have a corresponding skill that knows the right pattern. When in doubt, describe the problem in plain English to Claude — the task table in `AGENTS.md` and the "Workflows" table in `CLAUDE.md` route requests to the right guidance and workflow.

If a workflow should fire and doesn't, tell Claude "this phrase should have triggered X". Claude can add the routing row, and updates the affected manual or reference doc in the same change.
