# RLS Security Guide

Complete reference for Row Level Security in CRX Manager.

## What is RLS?

Row Level Security (RLS) controls which rows each user can see and modify in the database. Every table in CRX Manager has RLS enabled — this is mandatory. Without RLS policies, a table returns zero rows to everyone (which is the safe default).

---

## The 5 Stored Roles

Live `profiles_role_check` is
`CHECK (role = ANY (ARRAY['admin','sales_rep','driver','applicator','entity_recipient']))` — **5**
permitted values, read from live `pg_constraint` on 2026-08-19 UTC.

Four is what RLS uses: no policy in `public` references `entity_recipient` (`pg_policies`
matching it: **0**), but 2 live profiles carry that value, so a reader filtering on "the four
roles" would silently drop them.

All five, with the four **app roles** — the ones every policy below branches on — first:

| Role | Who | Access level |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `admin` | Mason and other administrators | Full access to everything |
| `sales_rep` | Sales representatives | Access to every customer and its records (contacts, documents, facts, interactions; since 2026-10-13), and to quotes and orders. Cannot reassign a customer, or change the commission split of a customer not assigned to them (trigger `customers_guard_rep_edit_20261013`). No access to month-end or settings; reads only their own commission rows (`comm_select`: `recipient_user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())`). |
| `driver` | Delivery drivers | Access to own assigned deliveries. Can confirm, complete, upload photos, report issues. |
| `applicator` | Chemical applicators | Access to own assigned jobs. Can record applied info. |
| `entity_recipient` | 2 live rows | **Permitted by the CHECK constraint but referenced by no policy.** Such a profile is treated as none of the four above: it fails `is_admin()`, `is_sales_rep()`, `is_driver()` and `is_applicator()`, so it sees only what a plain active profile sees. |

## Helper Functions

These SQL functions check the current user's role. They are `SECURITY DEFINER` and `STABLE`, meaning they run with elevated privileges and return the same result for the same arguments within one statement, which lets the planner avoid repeated calls (PostgreSQL does not promise to cache them). Each also requires the caller's profile to be active (`is_active = true`).

```sql
is_admin()       -- Returns TRUE if current user has role = 'admin'
is_sales_rep()   -- Returns TRUE if current user has role = 'sales_rep'
is_driver()      -- Returns TRUE if current user has role = 'driver'
is_applicator()  -- Returns TRUE if current user has role = 'applicator'
```

### How they work
Each function queries the `profiles` table for the current user's role. The live `is_admin()`
(latest body: `20260714185631_harden_is_admin_search_path.sql`) is:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public, pg_temp
STABLE
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
      FROM public.profiles
     WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid())
       AND role = 'admin'
       AND is_active = true
  );
END;
$$;
```
Copy that shape: a pinned `search_path` and the `is_active = true` check are both required.
`20260728233459_revoke_anon_execute_rls_role_helpers.sql` also revoked `EXECUTE` on `is_admin()`,
`is_driver()` and `is_applicator()` from `anon`, so a new helper should grant `EXECUTE` deliberately
(see `is_active_profile()` in `20260727174657_broad_reads_require_active_profile.sql`).

---

## Critical Rule: Always Use `(select auth.uid())`

**WRONG (evaluates per row — slow):**
```sql
USING (customer_id = auth.uid())
```

**RIGHT (evaluates once — fast):**
```sql
USING (customer_id = (select auth.uid()))
```

The parentheses and `select` keyword make PostgreSQL evaluate `auth.uid()` once per query instead of once per row. This is a major performance difference on large tables.

**Live does not fully satisfy this rule.** Read from live `pg_policies` on 2026-08-19 UTC, exactly
**three** policies in `public` still use bare `auth.uid()`:

| Policy | Command | Expression |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `tnotes_insert` | INSERT | `(created_by = auth.uid()) AND is_active_profile()` |
| `below_cost_approvals_admin_read` | SELECT | `... WHERE p.id = auth.uid() AND p.is_active AND p.role = 'admin'` |
| `credit_memo_apps_select` | SELECT | `... WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() AND profiles.is_active AND profiles.role IN ('admin','sales_rep')` |

All three are **correct on access** — this rule is about per-row evaluation cost, not security —
and all three sit on small tables (`team_notes` 55 rows, `credit_memo_applications` 1,
`below_cost_approvals` 0, read live 2026-08-19 UTC), so no fix ships here. It is recorded because a
reader taking this section as a description of live would be wrong three times, and because the
Safety Checklist at the bottom of this file asserts the same rule as if it held.

Re-check by stripping the *wrapped* form first and seeing what `auth.uid` is left — a plain
`like '%auth.uid()%'` matches every policy, since the correct form contains the same text:

```sql
with p as (
  select policyname, cmd,
         regexp_replace(coalesce(qual,'') || ' ~~ ' || coalesce(with_check,''),
                        '[(] SELECT auth[.]uid[(][)] AS uid[)]', 'OK', 'g') as s
    from pg_policies where schemaname = 'public'
)
select policyname, cmd from p where s ~ 'auth[.]uid' order by policyname;
```

## Common RLS Policy Patterns

### Pattern 1: Admin-only access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_select" ON public.table_name
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (is_admin());
```
Used on: `cost_history`. Re-read against live on 2026-08-19 UTC: that is the only admin-only
*read* among the tables this line used to name. `cycle_counts`, `cycle_count_items`,
`rebate_programs` and `rebate_claims` all read as `is_admin() OR is_sales_rep()`.

`cycle_count_items` is not carried in this file's matrix at all; its row lives in
`docs/reference/database-schema.md`. Their *writes*
are mostly admin-only but not uniformly: `rebate_claims` INSERT is `is_admin() OR
is_sales_rep()`, and the three `cycle_count_items` write policies are `is_admin() AND EXISTS
(… cycle_counts.status = 'in_progress')`, so even an admin cannot edit a closed count.

### Pattern 2: Any active profile can read
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_select" ON public.table_name
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING ((select is_active_profile()));
```
Used on: `products`, `app_settings`, `team_notes`, `activity_feed`, `warehouses`.

This block used to read `USING (true)` and to include `blend_recipes`. Both were stale.
`20260727174657_broad_reads_require_active_profile` (history row 828, applied live 2026-07-27)
narrowed the broad reads to `is_active_profile()`, so a deactivated profile is authenticated but
denied — and live `blend_recipes_select` is `is_admin() OR is_sales_rep() OR is_applicator()`,
which is why the matrix below reads `Admin / Sales Rep / Applicator` for it. **"All
authenticated" in the matrix means exactly this `is_active_profile()` predicate, not `true`.**

### Pattern 3: Admin + Sales Rep (with ownership)
```sql
-- Sales reps write their own, admin writes all
CREATE POLICY "quotes_update" ON public.quotes
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (
    is_admin()
    OR (is_sales_rep() AND created_by = (select auth.uid()))
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    is_admin()
    OR (is_sales_rep() AND created_by = (select auth.uid()))
  );
```
Used on the **write** side of `quotes` (INSERT and UPDATE), and on `quote_sections`
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE through an `EXISTS` on the parent quote's `created_by`.

**Not on the read side, which is what this block used to show.** Live `quotes_select` is
`is_admin() OR is_sales_rep()` with **no** ownership test; `qitems_select` is the same; and
`qsections_select` is `is_active_profile()`. The old example named `quotes_select` and added
the ownership half, so anyone copying it would have written a policy narrower than the one actually
deployed.

The matrix row below reads `Admin / Sales Rep` for SELECT, marking only INSERT and UPDATE
`(own)`.

### Pattern 4: Admin + Sales Rep + Driver (for deliveries)
```sql
-- Drivers see only their assigned deliveries
CREATE POLICY "del_select" ON public.deliveries
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (
    is_admin()
    OR is_sales_rep()
    OR assigned_driver = (select auth.uid())
  );
```
Live carries no `is_driver()` conjunct: the ownership test alone decides it, so a driver reaches
a delivery by being assigned to it rather than by holding the role. That is the same distinction
the matrix banner draws for the `Driver` cells. This block used to show the `is_driver() AND`
form, which is narrower than live.

### Pattern 5: Own data only
```sql
-- Users can only see their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "notif_select" ON public.notifications
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = (select auth.uid()));
```
Used on: `notifications`. Re-read against live 2026-08-19 UTC: the predicate is right, but this
block named the policy `notifications_select` and live is **`notif_select`**. Worth spelling out,
because `notifications` carries *both* prefixes live — `notif_select`, `notif_insert` and
`notif_update` for three commands, `notifications_admin_delete` for DELETE — so the wrong name
does not look wrong.

### Pattern 6: Insert own data
```sql
CREATE POLICY "activity_insert" ON public.activity_feed
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (performed_by = (select auth.uid()));
```
Used on: `activity_feed`. Same correction: predicate right, name wrong — this block said
`activity_feed_insert`, live is **`activity_insert`**. Patterns 5 and 6 are the two an earlier
sweep of this section checked and passed, and they were the two still wrong, because that sweep
compared predicates and never compared names.

### Pattern 7: Append-only (no updates or deletes)
```sql
-- financial_audit_log: insert only, no updates, no deletes
CREATE POLICY "financial_audit_insert" ON public.financial_audit_log
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (is_admin() OR actor_user_id = (select auth.uid()));

-- No UPDATE or DELETE policies = nobody can modify/delete rows
```
Used on: `financial_audit_log` (its SELECT is `is_admin()`). The append-only half is the point
and it holds — live has no UPDATE and no DELETE policy. The `WITH CHECK (true)` this block used
to show was stale: live also pins the actor.

## Debugging: Why Is My Query Returning Empty?

If a query returns no rows when you expect data:

### Step 1: Check RLS
The most common cause is an RLS policy blocking access. The query succeeds (no error) but returns empty data.

### Step 2: Use `checkMutationResult()`
For writes, always use:
```typescript
const result = await supabase.from('table').update({ ... }).eq('id', id).select();
checkMutationResult(result, 'Update table');
```
This throws an error if zero rows were affected, which catches silent RLS denials.

### Step 3: Test in SQL Editor
Run the query directly in the Supabase SQL Editor as the affected user:
```sql
-- Check what role the user has
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';

-- Test the query with that user's context
SET request.jwt.claims = '{"sub": "user-uuid-here"}';
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### Step 4: Check the policy
Look at the migration files for the table's RLS policies:
```bash
# Search for policies on a specific table
grep -r "CREATE POLICY.*table_name" supabase/migrations/
```

---

## Debugging: Why Is My Write Silently Failing?

Supabase returns `{ data: null, error: null }` when RLS blocks a write. This is NOT an error — it's a silent denial.

### Use `checkMutationResult()`
```typescript
const result = await supabase
  .from('customers')
  .update({ farm_name: 'New Name' })
  .eq('id', customerId)
  .select();

checkMutationResult(result, 'Update customer');
// Throws: "Update customer failed: no rows were affected. You may not have permission."
```

### Use `assertRpcResult()` for RPCs
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('my_function', { params });
const result = assertRpcResult<ReturnType>(data, 'my_function');
```

## Safety Checklist for RLS Changes

- [ ] Every new table has `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
- [ ] Every table has at least a SELECT policy
- [ ] Use `(select auth.uid())` not bare `auth.uid()` in all policies
- [ ] Use `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before `CREATE POLICY` for idempotency
- [ ] Test as all 4 app roles: admin, sales_rep, driver, applicator
- [ ] Use `checkMutationResult()` after every `.update()` and `.delete()`
- [ ] Use `assertRpcResult()` for SECURITY DEFINER RPCs
- [ ] Never remove existing RLS policies — add new ones or modify in a new migration
