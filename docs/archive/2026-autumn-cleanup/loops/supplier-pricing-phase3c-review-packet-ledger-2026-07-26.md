- Fixed trusted CI bootstrap ancestry floor:
  `d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c` (#255 after #251/#253;
  confirmed to lack both the
  checker and trusted target workflow; protected `main` descendants remain
  eligible without repinning).

  Product classifications or authorizes a Stage C migration/live apply.

## Owner-review packet closeout — 2026-07-27

### PR #246 containment correction — still PARKED

Current containment-correction provenance is fail-closed:

- `b30769b381d80b901aed73c254f5b9242f933e5a` is rejected. Its recorded
  containment proof checked 51,841 paths, 58 commits, 52,264 candidates, and
  823,721,338 logical bytes, but the GitHub Node 24 Linux job then exposed a
  deterministic glibc allocator abort in the 128 KiB embedded-Base64 boundary
  case.
- `ce16574b02ec9c4e40c351f69ba3e237caf2e9c4` is also rejected. It corrected
  only the three-file allocator-crash path; follow-up review still required
  PEM EOF finalization, bounded embedded whitespace and canonical padding,
  tri-state/over-bound gzip parsing with exact maximum-header overlap,
  authoritative alternate-index scanning, a commit-message hook, and fatal
  exact UTF-8 semantic parsing.
- A later literal Opus 5 review of exact `b30769b3` ran as
  `2026-07-27T23-29-35-252Z-3ef35b3a`. Statements later in this append-only
  historical ledger that no Opus 5 review had run refer to their older cycles
  and do not supersede this later exact-SHA provenance. Literal Opus 5 later
  reviewed exact `fa78c4f7` as `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS`; subsequent
  transfer-alignment and bounded-read corrections superseded that head.
  Acceptance always requires the current PR head to match a fresh exact-SHA
  wrapper capture.
- `49eb3f011da17d541bcd81cdd437da29db0c707e` contains the separately reviewed
  moving-main bootstrap/CI invariants only. It is an intermediate base, not an
  accepted containment candidate. The successor containing all bounded
  corrections remains pending its exact SHA, full proof, and fresh required
  reviews.
- Pre-freeze bounded-successor proof used synthetic data only. Three Node
  syntax checks passed; the focused Windows suite passed in 167.5 seconds; a
  clean disposable `node:24-bookworm` repository on Node 24.18.0 passed the
  same focused suite; and the real full worktree containment sweep passed for
  51,845 paths, 51,854 candidates, and 793,364,183 logical bytes. The focused
  suite includes real alternate-index and commit-message Git commits, exact
  gzip-boundary splits, Base64 boundary/fuzz/non-recursion cases, and fatal
  UTF-8 rejection. Local docs, shared-agent guidance, workflow, and mission-doc
  checks also passed. These are pre-commit proof facts, not an exact-SHA review
  or acceptance verdict.

No private packet was recaptured, regenerated, opened, or displayed during
this correction. No classification, flag, migration, live-data, deployment, or
merge authority changed.

Two real PR review findings are under bounded correction: ignored ordinary
non-regular filesystem entries (including tooling symlinks) must not be
dereferenced, while forbidden Phase 3C paths remain a fail-closed violation;
and future PR containment must run from `pull_request_target` using only the
trusted base workflow/checker while scanning fetched candidate Git objects, not
candidate files. The new target workflow has read-only `contents` permission,
no secret use, no candidate checkout, no candidate dependency/config loading,
and a 12-minute bound. The object fetch disables local Git hooks; candidate
Git configuration/hooks cannot enter a commit object and are never loaded.

This is intentionally a **future-PR guard**. PR #246 is open, and its
historical base `0e058804090b84f9a14024a6666021a271bb1f71` predates this workflow, so GitHub
does not evaluate it for this PR. The existing `pull_request` job remains
bootstrap/defense-in-depth only and cannot be represented as a trusted-base
hard gate for PR #246. This record remains `PARKED`; it does not authorize a
packet review, classification, Stage C action, live mutation, flag enablement,
deployment, or merge.

External enforcement remains absent even after this local workflow correction.
Live GitHub `protect-main` ruleset `18904218` does **not** require the new
trusted containment workflow. Ordinary required status checks are not bound to
an immutable workflow/event identity, so they do not by themselves provide
non-spoofable `pull_request_target` enforcement. This remains `PARKED` pending
an organization/enterprise required-workflow mechanism or equivalent external
App/ruleset enforcement, followed by real post-activation proof. This record
does not represent that external control as configured or PR #246 as protected
by it.

Historical #245 reconciliation was repeated normally: merge
`c6c5ea3ae0e2af5c67f8c55d64d930877e5c6cc1` has parents
`28425be514a8f30225189533c88b108d807b58bd` and
`0e058804090b84f9a14024a6666021a271bb1f71` (`#245`), with no conflicts or
containment-file overlap. `#245` changes only production-health skill guidance,
Dependabot, changelog, and dependency metadata. Exact Git object checks prove
that new base lacks both the checker and trusted target workflow, so the
candidate-controlled bootstrap pin was updated to that then-current SHA. The
ruleset gap above remains unresolved; this reconciliation does not mark the PR
ready. Historical #247 reconciliation then merged `origin/main`
`07a3d4833cf8517ea53831a6ff0976b4a6c4c67f` (#247) through normal merge
`98969765030d8ada43566fad606f4d74057d1e17` without conflicts. #247 changes
only the active-profile RLS migration and reference docs; it has no Phase 3C
containment overlap. Exact object checks proved that #247's `07a3` base lacked
both guard files, so its then-active one-time CI bootstrap pin was
`07a3d4833cf8517ea53831a6ff0976b4a6c4c67f`. Historical #248 reconciliation merged
the docs-only `origin/main` `d3bac970804bf6130b6bf6259eed05fad0367a9c` through
normal merge `d0ff8e0b5ee59cd56f1c093fea92dba266fd17f3` without conflicts.
Exact object checks confirmed that historical base also lacked both guard files.
Historical #250 base `3ca289c5c5b91c800a350ab828a6000bd3d399e6`
followed #249 and was incorporated through normal merge
`35ec8fde0dc1d0ebce956f64d4320dc4d5536820`. Historical #253 base
`dd33f162365913867ff3aefd0b7e540a531d102f` was incorporated through merge
`8de484afe9eb4f4e2c50ce9611538535caf533d8`. Historical #251
baseline-refresh base `2a9e9252a62642e51b71c248c8c2f149a9a434d9` was followed
by #253. Fixed floor established 2026-07-26: #255 base
`d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c`, the sole fixed trusted
bootstrap ancestry floor, also lacks both guard files.

Published `f3b636590a784b2cf9bf4e03bc47da55adbc4e60` arrived concurrently as
provenance-unattributed publication-parent hardening. It was adopted only after
this bounded review confirmed its held-directory descriptor/path inode
revalidation, and the POSIX relocation fixture now requires the exact safe
`private artifact parent changed before publication` failure. It does not close
the external trusted-workflow/ruleset gap; PR #246 remains `PARKED`.

The published PR head `bc305778037fe064b272ebae0aca567ed5f2f8e3` received a
technical Sol `CLEAN` review. This is technical evidence only: acceptance
requires the PR's current head to match a recorded exact-reviewed SHA, and any
later head change invalidates prior head-bound evidence and requires a fresh
exact proof/review cycle.

### Reviewed packet commit `d38d41f63e68971f08f7158bf5a104af62d232aa` — PARKED

`d38d41f63e68971f08f7158bf5a104af62d232aa` has immutable parent
`07813f698e4cf12e09fd4378837f5134ed5c3850`, the engineering candidate whose
Graphify evidence reports 8,389 nodes and 17,472 edges. The parent focused
packet proof passed in 58.9 seconds; parent containment passed for 51,820
paths, 11 commits, 51,888 candidates, and 795,308,573 logical bytes. Normal
`07813f69` commit hooks passed: 302 test files, 3,985 passed, 118 skipped;
lint/typecheck/build/workflows/guards/docs/dependency integrity were green, with
four existing lint warnings.

- Orchestrator read-only capture recorded count 604 at
  `2026-07-27T11:14:57.085929Z`. Guard evidence is aggregate-only: correct
  project, Stage A ledger present, valid migration high-water,
  `product_families_count=0`, and `supplier_cost_basis_enabled=false`.

- Manifest verify and reproducibility passed at count 604 with the same
  semantic hash. Owner-sheet write/verify passed at count 604 with the same
  semantic hash. These are the only current owner-review packet values; every
  older packet hash below is historical and invalidated. The packet has been
  regenerated and verified, but owner review remains closed until PR #246's
  current head matches a recorded exact-reviewed SHA, required checks and
  CodeRabbit are resolved, and external trusted-workflow/ruleset activation is
  proven.
- Exact `d38d41f` reviews: independent Sol returned `FIX` for documentation
  status/provenance findings only (HIGH: premature READY claim; MEDIUM: stale
  uncommitted/no-self-SHA and regeneration wording). Sol found code sound:
  focused proof, syntax, `check:docs`, and `git diff --check` passed; containment
  passed for 51,825 paths, 12 commits, 51,895 candidates, and 795,855,426
  logical bytes, with no private content inspected. Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`,
  session `019fa353-0229-74a0-a350-d24e700437b7`, returned `PASS`; containment
  passed for 51,827 paths, 12 commits, 51,897 candidates, and 796,622,451
  logical bytes. Its sandbox `EPERM` temporary-fixture limitation was disclosed.
- Claude wrapper run `2026-07-27T11-31-40-990Z-ebe70a0a` reviewed exact
  `d38d41f` at `xhigh`: requested `opus`, resolved helper
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and reviewer `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned
  `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no BLOCKER/HIGH finding. No literal Opus 5 review
  is claimed. Its conditional MEDIUM bootstrap mismatch is historical review
  evidence only: a fresh fetch then confirmed `origin/main` at
  `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511`; this branch was 0 behind / 12
  ahead. The LOW stale-provenance follow-up agreed with Sol; its fetch-depth
  cost was harmless and did not warrant a change then.
- Exact `a2002c3c35d78be07690ff643d8d4c7dfceee0cb` review: Sol returned `FIX`
  solely for stale present-tense historical provenance in these public records.
  Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session `019fa36b-2f16-7390-b080-9f7808474f82`, returned
  `PASS`. Claude wrapper run `2026-07-27T11-58-55-371Z-99f2ff2b` reviewed exact
  `a2002c3c` at `xhigh`: requested `opus`, resolved helper
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and reviewer `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned
  `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no unresolved BLOCKER/HIGH/MED finding.
- Exact `a7506a01a9d65849a160ee608cdb36b4d60501ba` review: Sol returned `FIX`
  for two MEDIUM current-document contradictions and accepted LOW follow-ups;
  its focused, syntax, documentation, workflow, and containment proof was
  green for 51,838 paths, 14 commits, 51,912 candidates, and 799,476,952
  logical bytes. Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session
  `019fa381-40b5-77e0-964f-d7aafc35b7fd`, returned `FIX` for MEDIUM summary
  provenance; its focused fixture sandbox limitation was `EPERM` only. Claude
  VERIFIED run `2026-07-27T12-30-09-152Z-663c4f7b` reviewed exact `a7506a01`
  at `xhigh`: requested `opus`, resolved helper
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and reviewer `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned
  `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no BLOCKER/HIGH finding. The conditional
  bootstrap-base drift disposition was fail-closed: fetch `origin/main` again
  before publication. No CI/code change was warranted while that historical
  base remained pinned to `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511`.
- Exact `3c156065680fb2cc3efc6a35c0d78158e84da924` non-final exact review
  cycle: Sol returned `CLEAN` with no unresolved BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM finding,
  and Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session
  `019fa399-ea5b-7b93-953d-f27f42eef3d4`, returned `PASS`. Sol's retained LOW
  follow-ups are historical imperative plan wording, a fresh bootstrap refetch
  before publication, and the Ubuntu protected-PR CI requirement. Accepted
  conservative generic-signature false-positive and precommit-cost LOWs require
  no containment-code change. Git ownership/temp `EPERM` and a missing Graphify
  Python runtime were environment-only limitations. Claude VERIFIED run
  `2026-07-27T12-49-03-719Z-95010716` reviewed exact `3c156065680fb2cc3efc6a35c0d78158e84da924`
  at `xhigh`: requested `opus`, resolved helper `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
  and reviewer `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no
  BLOCKER/HIGH finding. Its MEDIUM finding was this summary's stale
  `a200`/`d38` correction-cycle provenance; the ledger's `a750`/`a200`
  provenance is the corrected source of truth. The combined `3c156065` cycle
  was not final because that resolved Opus MEDIUM required the `a10bad90`
  correction.
- Exact `a10bad90e990e83a2c650ee66a44828f317797a7` is the immediate reviewed
  source for this correction, not a final acceptance claim. Independent Sol
  returned `FIX` for one MEDIUM incomplete `3c156065` durable-review chain.
  Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session `019fa3ae-40b6-7ff1-92c1-282bdac567d3`, returned
  `FIX` for one MEDIUM stale active loop charter that still directed SAFE PREP,
  595-active, and capture/materialization work. Claude VERIFIED run
  `2026-07-27T13-11-06-599Z-9df51ac6` reviewed exact `a10bad90` at `xhigh`:
  requested `opus`, resolved helper `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and reviewer
  `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no BLOCKER/HIGH
  finding. Its operational bootstrap-pin MEDIUM was mitigated by the fresh
  refetch but must be rechecked immediately before any push. Accepted LOWs are
  the 100,000-candidate ceiling/precommit cost and the unreachable current
  `ZERO_SHA` push nit; neither warrants a code change. A final exact review of
  this correction's containing SHA remains pending.
- Exact `80741157bb6b127f88d26cd1b4c8c0d5d33bd357` is the reviewed source for
  this publication-reconciliation correction, not a final acceptance claim.
  Sol returned `FIX` for a HIGH publication blocker: `origin/main` advanced and
  the loop omitted the validator's exact `## Definition of done` heading. Luna
  `gpt-5.6-luna`, session `019fa3c4-0937-7fc0-a83c-2bbdb9af113a`, returned
  `FIX` for the validator issue and external-base drift. Claude VERIFIED run
  `2026-07-27T13-36-27-572Z-3b602557` reviewed exact `80741157` at `xhigh`:
  requested `opus`, resolved helper `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and reviewer
  `claude-opus-4-8`, and returned `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS` with no BLOCKER/HIGH
  finding. Its operational bootstrap MEDIUM requires the current base to be
  rechecked immediately before any push; engineering and privacy evidence were
  otherwise clean.
- Historical first branch reconciliation: normal non-rebased merge
  `a9817b05d35bc39e13bad94d7680181461b6fcb7` incorporated current
  `origin/main` `48bd1982c9553c2022fe96be771974ad699be12e` without conflicts
  and preserved feature history. That historical main lacked the containment
  checker, so its then-current one-time CI bootstrap pin was exactly
  `48bd1982c9553c2022fe96be771974ad699be12e`. It was later superseded by the
  current-base reconciliation below.
- Historical #245 branch reconciliation was superseded by the current #247
  base: normal non-rebased
  merge `c6c5ea3ae0e2af5c67f8c55d64d930877e5c6cc1` incorporated
  `origin/main` `0e058804090b84f9a14024a6666021a271bb1f71` without conflicts.
  That historical base lacked both containment guard files. Historical #247
  normal
  merge `98969765030d8ada43566fad606f4d74057d1e17` incorporates
  `origin/main` `07a3d4833cf8517ea53831a6ff0976b4a6c4c67f`, which likewise
  lacks both guard files; its then-active bootstrap pin was
  `07a3d4833cf8517ea53831a6ff0976b4a6c4c67f`. Historical #248 docs-only base
  was `d3bac970804bf6130b6bf6259eed05fad0367a9c`. Historical #250 base and pin
  were `3ca289c5c5b91c800a350ab828a6000bd3d399e6`, incorporated through normal
  merge `35ec8fde0dc1d0ebce956f64d4320dc4d5536820` after #249. Historical #253 base
  and pin were `dd33f162365913867ff3aefd0b7e540a531d102f`,
  incorporated through merge `8de484afe9eb4f4e2c50ce9611538535caf533d8`.
  Historical #251 baseline-refresh base and pin were
  `2a9e9252a62642e51b71c248c8c2f149a9a434d9`. Current #255 base is the fixed
  trusted ancestry floor `d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c`.
  Refetch and verify current `main` descends from that floor before publication; the external
  trusted-workflow/ruleset enforcement gap remains `PARKED`.
- Owner gate: Mason must not review the private owner sheet yet. All decisions
  remain `PENDING` across all 604 rows; no Product classification is approved.
  Acceptance requires PR #246's current head to match a recorded exact-reviewed
  SHA; any later head change invalidates that evidence. Before any future
  publication, freshly refetch `origin/main` and verify it descends from
  bootstrap floor `d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c`. Required checks —
  including Ubuntu PR CI — real CodeRabbit findings resolved, and external
  trusted-workflow/ruleset activation plus post-activation proof remain
  mandatory. Only afterward may Mason review every
  decision field and unresolved acknowledgment before a separate Stage C design
  mission is considered. No Stage C SQL/migration/apply, live mutation, flag
  enablement, deploy, or merge is authorized here.
- SHA ledger rule: this correction cycle was produced by reviewed source
  `a7506a01a9d65849a160ee608cdb36b4d60501ba` with parent `a2002c3c`.
  That durable review-cycle anchor is not a claim about any containing
  correction commit's immediate parent. Identify each containing/final SHA only
  through Git and PR metadata, never by guessing it here, and never
  mechanically roll the anchor forward in a later documentation correction.
  Any future model alias must record its resolved model truthfully.

### Prior rejected implementation `c1b54a5b603ee6f5dc5a6edc79979326a40dfdd8` — historical correction cycle

`c1b54a5b603ee6f5dc5a6edc79979326a40dfdd8` is rejected. Its immutable parent
is `3695f42e3ec6f57dae4d07d534a4a191bfa2a46d`; `c1b54a5b` was the implementation
SHA for the preceding correction, not a passing release.

- Graphify was refreshed at exact rejected `c1b54a5b`: 8,390 nodes and 17,479
  edges. It confirmed the atomic writer's direct packet consumers; current
  source remains the authority for those edges.
- Independent Sol returned `PASS` at `c1b54a5b`, but that pass was invalidated
  by Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session
  `019fa313-ee55-7042-9074-08b0be3dd747`, returning `FIX`: the atomic writer
  opened and wrote its temporary artifact before acquiring the stable parent,
  so a POSIX parent relocation could strand intended private temp bytes in the
  moved original directory.
- Its accepted correction captured the initial parent identity, acquired the
  nonreentrant stable-parent CWD lease before creating a temp file, and retained
  it through relative-basename writing, validation, publication, readback,
  descriptor close, and owned-temp cleanup.

### Earlier rejected implementation `3695f42e3ec6f57dae4d07d534a4a191bfa2a46d` — historical correction cycle

`3695f42e3ec6f57dae4d07d534a4a191bfa2a46d` is rejected. Its immutable parent
is `2adff51bfa27ea50274230845bb4c89f4037313e`; `3695f42e` was the implementation
SHA for the preceding correction, not a passing release.

- Graphify was refreshed at exact rejected `3695f42e`: 8,382 nodes and 17,446
  edges. It confirmed the GitHub-event containment entry point, its packet-test
  caller, and the atomic writer's capture/manifest/owner-sheet consumers;
  current source remains the authority for these edges.
- Independent Sol returned `FIX`: owner CSV headers could cross CR/LF/VT/FF,
  NEL, U+2028/U+2029, and C0 record boundaries that direct and streaming
  detectors handled differently.
- Luna `gpt-5.6-luna`, session
  `019fa2e4-9bc8-71a3-a64a-a5baef795e78`, returned `FIX`: textual CI
  compatibility could accept a dead marker, `rev-list` materialized an
  unbounded history before rejection, and final parent-path revalidation left
  a publication TOCTOU, and ledger/summary bookkeeping was stale.

At that historical point, this rejected correction was
`PARKED — TOOLING CORRECTION; HISTORICAL PACKET REGENERATION REQUIRED` pending
a frozen successor with exact-SHA proof and reviews. That superseded status
does not override the current parked status at the top of this ledger.

### Exact rejected candidate `2adff51bfa27ea50274230845bb4c89f4037313e` — historical SAFE PREP correction

This candidate is rejected. The private packet remains historical and
invalidated; nothing in this correction approves a Product, creates Stage C
SQL, changes the flag, accesses private rows, or changes a live system.

- Exact base: `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511`.
- Graphify was refreshed at the rejected HEAD: `2adff51b` / 8,360 nodes and
  17,396 edges. It confirmed the containment checker imports the private
  artifact helper and is reached by the packet test; the atomic writer is used
  by capture, manifest, and owner-sheet entry points. Current source remains
  the authority for those edges.
- Luna `gpt-5.6-luna` session `019fa291-ede9-7ab0-8491-5c20f605d3d9`
  returned `FIX`: PR containment executed candidate-controlled code; worktree
  link/reparse rejection happened after the non-file skip; and large ignored
  owner sheets could bypass the ASCII-only stream matcher with Unicode
  whitespace.
- Fresh independent Sol returned `FIX`: UTF-16 (BOM/no-BOM and chunk
  boundaries), Git type changes/modes, in-place final-target truncation, CI
  ordering, bounded large Git blobs, and deterministic cap behavior all needed
  correction. The review also required no diagnostic content disclosure.
- Accepted local correction scope: post-bootstrap trusted-base checker
  execution for PR events with a validated candidate-root handoff;
  runner-bundled Node before any candidate Node configuration;
  UTF-8/UTF-16LE/UTF-16BE stream scanning at both UTF-16 byte alignments;
  mode/type rejection; 64 MiB per candidate, 2 GiB logical candidate-byte,
  and 100,000-candidate fail-closed caps; a 4,096 checked-commit cap
  (calibrated above this candidate's 2,073 commits) plus a
  remaining-candidate-budget history-path cap before per-path tree resolution;
  and fsynced-temp atomic replacement rather than live-target truncation.
- Bootstrap truth: exact base `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511`
  has no containment checker. Therefore this introducing PR uses only its
  exact-base-SHA-gated, exact committed-head-blob/path-verified candidate
  checker; that coverage is explicitly candidate-controlled. After bootstrap,
  the CI workflow uses the exact trusted-base checker only when it contains
  the declared handoff protocol. A present-but-incompatible checker, or a
  missing checker on any later base, fails closed rather than falling back.
- Historical SHA bookkeeping: this earlier correction was later frozen as the
  rejected implementation `3695f42e`. Its introducing-workflow limitation is
  retained as historical context; current-cycle SHA bookkeeping is defined in
  the `3695f42e` section above.

At that historical point, this cycle was
`PARKED — TOOLING CORRECTION; HISTORICAL PACKET REGENERATION REQUIRED` until
focused/full proof and exact-SHA Graphify, Luna, independent-Sol, and
resolved-Opus reviews completed on a frozen candidate. That historical gate was
superseded by later correction cycles.

The bounded post-PARK safety recovery materialized a new packet, but both fresh
exact-SHA reviewers then returned `FIX` for the containment tooling. The packet
is therefore historical only and is not delivery-ready. This does **not** amend
or conceal the mission's six-cycle cap: the earlier candidate cycles remain
historical, and no packet approves Product classifications or a Stage C
migration/live apply.

- Rewritten-provenance candidate before this documentation update:
  `4f4b863b53596088d58162f44e2a6e2e43e58f79`. Every post-setup commit on that
  local candidate is authored `Mason <mason@croprxsolutions.com>`; its tree was
  checked against the local backup and matched. No remote branch exists.
- Fresh Luna exact-SHA review: session
  `019fa229-bc19-77b2-92bf-7f270e1cddc8`, verdict `FIX`.
- Fresh independent Sol exact-SHA review: candidate
  `d01a8f099394e8c7882736ac52fd81c6d2de8c15`, verdict `FIX`.
  Both reviews required fail-closed Git-root admission, structural/index/large
  ignored-file containment, full identity/read stability, and descriptor-safe
  writer corrections. Their findings are addressed by the new bounded local
  correction set, but that then-uncommitted set had not yet received exact-SHA
  reviews. Later successor cycles superseded that historical state.
- Prior Sol `FIX` findings being remediated: arbitrary external directories
  (including a sibling linked worktree) were admitted; tip-only containment
  missed a packet committed then deleted; filename/signature checks missed
  minified renamed packet structures; CI ran containment after other content
  processors; and synthetic Git fixtures did not prove real repository Git
  identity preservation.
- Follow-on orchestrator audit correction: a then-uncommitted recovery patch
  preserved the opened temporary file identity through the pre-rename boundary,
  scanned merge-resolution blobs with a merge-aware Git diff, and rejected BOM-
  prefixed packet structures or a worktree candidate whose identity/size changed
  while it was being scanned. Focused synthetic regressions covered all three;
  independent review was then required before freeze or packet regeneration.
- Blocked-freeze correction: the first historical commit-hook freeze attempt exposed that
  inherited Git hook variables could redirect the checker away from its explicit
  root, producing an invalid fixture range. Checker Git subprocesses now strip
  every `GIT_*` variable and use their supplied working root. The focused packet
  suite and the full correction-guard suite both pass under representative
   `GIT_DIR`/work-tree/index/common/object redirection variables; no commit was
  made by that recovery writer.
- Historical pre-freeze local proof for the then-uncommitted bounded correction:
  focused
  packet suite PASS in 29.3 seconds; full correction-guard suite PASS in 38.9
  seconds; typecheck PASS in 21.1 seconds; production build PASS in 18.2
  seconds; lint PASS with zero errors and four pre-existing warnings. The full
  containment range
  `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511..d01a8f099394e8c7882736ac52fd81c6d2de8c15`
  PASSed in 22.4 seconds (`checked_paths=51810`, `checked_commits=6`). This is
  local tooling evidence only, not a substitute for then-required exact-SHA
  reviews or packet regeneration. Documentation drift and whitespace validation
  also PASSed on that pre-freeze record.
- A fresh live read-only capture completed at `2026-07-27T05:53:04.476876Z`:
  604 Products (595 active, 9 inactive), one active-return conflict, all 604
  unresolved, zero family assignments, and zero standalone classifications.
  The Stage A ledger row `20260723193312` is present, migration high-water is
  `20260726223520`, `product_families_count` is 0, and
  `supplier_cost_basis_enabled` is `false`.
- The prior capture, external count/hash binding, manifest write/verify/compare,
  and owner-sheet write/verify passed, but their resulting hashes below are
  **historical and invalidated** by this tooling correction. No private rows or
  identifiers are recorded in this repository.
- Full commit-hook proof passed on the earlier rewritten candidate: 302 files checked;
  3,985 tests passed and 118 skipped; lint had zero errors and four warnings;
  typecheck, build, agent workflows, correction guards, docs, and dependency
  checks passed.
- At that historical point, Graphify, Luna, independent-Sol, and
  latest-available Opus exact-SHA reviews were required after a correction
  freeze; the packet then needed regeneration and re-verification before
  protected-PR/CodeRabbit handling. That historical state was superseded and
  does not describe the current regenerated-and-verified packet.

### Position-sensitive containment correction

The next frozen candidate,
`2c56085d1ecee3ca223efb3ec0da58fa6ef858db`, was also rejected. Fresh
independent Sol returned `FIX` for three position-sensitive containment
classes: a non-comment/non-whitespace prefix before private JSON; a private
Product/manifest row later in a valid JSON wrapper or array; and an authentic
owner-sheet header after comments or late padding. Luna session
`019fa26f-821d-7611-b7d6-82d90ac35fb9` independently returned `FIX` and
required the adjacent nested/wrapped, escaped/malformed, beyond-first-1-KiB,
chunk-boundary, and greater-than-8-MiB ignored-file variants to be closed.

A then-uncommitted Terra sole-writer correction historically iterated over
every node in bounded valid JSON, applies decoded position-independent strong
property signatures to malformed or prefixed content, recognizes the exact
owner header on any line, and scans every byte of modified, untracked, and
ignored worktree candidates twice through a descriptor-bound reader with
complete stat identity and SHA-256 equality checks. The real repository
containment baseline passed across 51,810 paths in 64.4 seconds; the expanded
synthetic packet suite passed in 39.1 seconds. These are local correction
proofs only. The exact rejected SHA remains rejected and the historical packet
hashes remain invalidated. Its then-outstanding freeze/review/regeneration
requirements were superseded by later correction cycles.

Broader pre-freeze proof also passed: correction guards, typecheck, production
build, agent-workflow tests, documentation drift, dependency consistency, and
the five-slot mission-document validator. Lint reported zero errors and the
same four pre-existing warnings. Exact containment across
`052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511..2c56085d1ecee3ca223efb3ec0da58fa6ef858db`
passed after checking 51,810 paths and all 7 commits in 73.3 seconds.
`git diff --check` also passed. This was a then-uncommitted, unreviewed
correction and was not a final packet proof; later successor cycles superseded
it.

## Cycle 0 — preflight

### Repository and collision evidence

- Base at mission creation: `052b2171821dc7ffd965b4edb4b6de4ef8fda511`.
- Mission setup candidate: `9bf567bf`.
- Aggregate preflight: 604 Products / 595 active; zero family assignments,
  non-`unknown` policies, packaging variants, tote flags, and Product families;
  one Product in an active return; Stage A ledger present; live high-water
  `20260726223520`; `supplier_cost_basis_enabled = false`.

### Graphify evidence

- Graphify refreshed from build `052b2171`.

### Live read-only evidence

Pre-setup aggregate check observed:

- Product count: 604
- Active Products: 595
- Family assigned: 0
- Non-`unknown` policy: 0
- Packaging variant set: 0
- Tote-only set: 0
- Product families: 0
- Products in an active return: 1
- Stage A ledger row: present as server version `20260723193312`
- Live migration high-water: `20260726223520`
- `supplier_cost_basis_enabled`: `false`

These were historical preflight observations, not a captured or approved
classification packet. They were superseded by the current regenerated-and-
verified packet and are not an instruction to refresh or materialize again.

### Agent and harness evidence

- `npm run agent-health` returned green during mission setup.
- Design-adversary review run
  `2026-07-27T02-32-15-864Z-687a8c46`: requested alias `opus` resolved to
  `claude-opus-4-8`; verdict `SHIP`. This is the latest available resolved
  Opus provenance for the run. No Opus 5 review ran; a literal Opus 5 rerun is
  optional if that backend becomes available.

### PROOF

- `PROOF — Ran:` aggregate preflight, Graphify refresh, and agent-health during mission setup.
- `PROOF — Saw:` values and provenance recorded above; no private Product rows entered the repository.
- `Not verified at original preflight:` Cycle 2 final candidate/review proof and
  all later cycles; that historical limitation is superseded by the records above.

## Findings and correction lessons

### Historical correction 6 — superseded Terra writer

- Exact reviewed candidate: `ee9183eef017affb8170fa8cdb7c4cb84e87c7c1`.
- Independent Sol: `gpt-5.6-sol`, session `019fa1b9-5cfb-7e33-81fd-23cb72636875`, verdict `FIX`.
- Luna bookkeeping review: `gpt-5.6-luna`, session
  `019fa1b9-5cf2-7023-aff1-0d79befd6b1d`, verdict `FIX` only for circular
  historical pending-review bookkeeping.
- Resolved Opus review: run `2026-07-27T04-03-37-498Z-1eab779e`, requested
  alias `opus` resolved to `claude-opus-4-8`, verdict `SHIP-WITH-FOLLOWUPS`;
  no Opus 5 review ran or is claimed.
- Historical writer: `gpt-5.6-terra`; its fix patch was then-uncommitted.
- Sol dispositions: clean-checkout Git-native containment and bounded worktree
  scan — implemented; pre-push/CI fail-closed wiring — implemented; v2 external
  hash/count binding for every consumer — implemented; exact Supabase warning
  envelope — implemented; parent-junction reader/writer safeguards and safe
  temp cleanup — implemented; malformed-manifest categorical JSON failure —
  implemented; claimed regression restoration — in focused proof; no finding
  was weakened or dismissed.
- Opus follow-ups: runtime enum allowlists/schema-registry equality —
  implemented; bounded Git/native scan and synthetic fake-repository isolation
  — implemented; live-hash provenance remains an orchestrator proof item and
  is not self-certified here.
- Sol regenerated the historical private packet at `2026-07-27T05:53:04.476876Z`
  after the rewritten safety-tooling candidate. Capture, external count/hash
  binding, manifest write/verify and deterministic compare, and owner-sheet
  write/verify all passed. The aggregate hashes below are historical. At that
  time exact final-SHA Graphify and Luna/independent-Sol/latest-available Opus
  reviews were pending. Both later exact-SHA reviews returned `FIX`, so this
  materialization was superseded by the current packet rather than a current
  regeneration obligation.
- Graphify had been refreshed after those then-uncommitted edits: 8,309 nodes /
  17,245 edges. Its report recorded HEAD `ee9183ee`; because Graphify records a
  committed HEAD rather than an uncommitted patch, an exact final-SHA refresh
  was then pending after a later freeze. That historical pending state is
  superseded.

Private materialization was then `PENDING` and is historical. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Synthetic version-`0`, malformed-shape/non-hex, sorted-order, and duplicate regressions PASS via `npm run test:supplier-pricing-phase3c-packet`; containment PASS via `npm run check:phase3-private-artifacts`. |

| C3-LUNA-5 | same provenance | MEDIUM | CLI envelope row accepted unexpected keys. | FIX: exact singleton `phase3_snapshot` row-key contract. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Extra-key envelope regression. |
| C3-LUNA-6 | same provenance | MEDIUM | Generator CLI allowed ambiguous flag combinations. | FIX: strict exactly-one-mode parser with duplicate, unknown, missing-value, and positional-junk rejection; v2 environment default. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Spawned invalid-combination and synthetic valid-mode regressions. |
| C3-LUNA-7 | same provenance | MEDIUM | Public materialization disclosure was required. | FIX: aggregate-only owner-review summary added; it states correction-3 invalidation and owner gate. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Public-document review; no row content included. |
| C3-LUNA-8 | same provenance | MEDIUM | Ledger needed Correction 3 provenance and invalidation. | FIX: the historical ledger then recorded all dispositions, supplied aggregate hashes only, a historical Terra writer, and then-pending final reviews/proof/commit/PR. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Ledger review was then pending final proof. |
| C4-SOL-1 | Sol orchestrator cycle 4 | HIGH | Validated pathname then direct pathname read left a replacement window. | FIX: open read-only with no-follow where supported; compare descriptor and fresh pathname identities, require one regular link before consuming bytes, recheck after reading, and close in `finally`. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Synthetic injected replacement-race regression proves repository target content is neither returned nor changed. |
| C4-SOL-2 | Sol orchestrator cycle 4 | HIGH | Approved basenames did not contain a private snapshot, manifest, or owner-sheet payload renamed to a benign path. | FIX: bounded Git-change candidate inspection checks staged index and worktree candidates for exact approved JSON-format or owner-CSV-header signatures without logging content. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Disposable Git regressions cover renamed staged snapshot/manifest content, staged/worktree divergence, untracked content, and benign public text. |
| C4-SOL-3 | Sol orchestrator cycle 4 | MEDIUM | Several packet entry points tolerated duplicate, unknown, missing-value, or positional CLI input. | FIX: capture accepts no CLI input; manifest and owner entry points use strict named-path option parsing while preserving the generator's exactly-one-mode parser and v2 environment default. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Spawned synthetic invalid-input regressions cover every packet CLI without exposing synthetic identifiers. |
| C4-SELF-1 | Real Husky pre-commit pipeline | HIGH | The staged candidate's real `git commit` ran Husky; all earlier gates passed until `npm run test:correction-guards`. The disposable fixture inherited hook-local Git variables, so fixture `git init` targeted the shared Git directory, set common `core.bare=true`, and fixture `git add README.md` failed: `fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree`. No commit was created. | FIX: sanitize all case-insensitive `GIT_*` variables for every disposable fixture Git command, including injected checker Git calls. Regression injects hostile `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, and `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, proves the fixture initializes, adds and commits its README in its own worktree, and proves the real repository remains a worktree with common `core.bare=false` before and after. Shared repository common `core.bare=false` was repaired and reverified. A later historical materialization established hashes later superseded by the current aggregate hashes; exact final-SHA reviews were then pending. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Focused hostile-hook-context regression PASS; later full commit-hook proof PASS. |
| C5-SOL-1 | Historical independent Sol review of `2c56085d1ecee3ca223efb3ec0da58fa6ef858db` | BLOCKER | Any non-whitespace/comment prefix before otherwise exact private JSON bypassed staged, history, pre-push, and CI range containment. | FIX in a then-uncommitted historical Terra correction: decoded exact format key/value and strong private property signatures are position-independent and do not require JSON at byte zero. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Staged, deleted-history, real pre-push, pull-request event, push event, untracked, ignored, escaped-malformed, and benign public-source regressions PASS. |
| C5-SOL-2 | same historical provenance | HIGH | A benign first row hid a later private Product/manifest row because only the first row/root was inspected. | FIX in a then-uncommitted historical Terra correction: an iterative bounded walk inspects every object and array element, including arbitrary wrappers and nesting, with a fail-closed node bound. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Later Product and manifest row fixtures PASS across staged, ignored, history, pre-push, and CI event layers. |
| C5-SOL-3 | same historical provenance | HIGH | A commented/late owner CSV header, including a greater-than-8-MiB ignored file, bypassed containment. | FIX in a then-uncommitted historical Terra correction: the normalized exact ordered header is recognized on any line; the streaming detector retains state and signatures across chunks. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Late/commented staged/history/event fixtures and greater-than-8-MiB whitespace/header chunk-boundary fixtures PASS. |
| C5-LUNA-1 | Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`, session `019fa26f-821d-7611-b7d6-82d90ac35fb9`) | HIGH | Luna returned `FIX` and required adjacent arrays/wrappers/nesting, escaped or malformed prefixed JSON, signatures beyond 1 KiB, later incomplete-root rows, and streaming chunk boundaries to fail closed. | FIX in a then-uncommitted historical Terra correction without filename or path allowlists; modified/untracked files above the structural bound remain unconditionally rejected and all ignored bytes are streamed. | historical `gpt-5.6-terra` | then-uncommitted historical patch | Expanded focused suite PASS in 39.1 seconds; real 51,810-path containment baseline PASS in 64.4 seconds. |

## Owner gate after this mission (historical — July 2026; superseded by the 2026-09-26 status update below)

The packet has been regenerated and verified. Mason must not review any private
row yet: PR #246's current head must match a recorded exact-reviewed SHA, and
any later head change invalidates prior head-bound evidence. Before any future
publication, freshly refetch `origin/main` and verify it descends from
bootstrap floor `d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c`. Required checks,
including Ubuntu PR CI, must be green, any real CodeRabbit finding resolved,
and external trusted-workflow/ruleset activation plus post-activation proof
complete before acceptance. Only
then must Mason review every row disposition, proposed family, packaging,
tote-only, and policy change; explicitly acknowledge every unresolved row; and
approve the exact current aggregate-bound packet. All decisions remain
`PENDING` and no classification is approved. Only then may a separate Stage C
design mission be considered; this record authorizes no Stage C migration/apply,
live mutation, flag enablement, deploy, or merge.

## Closeout

- `DONE:` exact `07813f69` engineering proof, aggregate-only capture, manifest reproducibility, owner-sheet verification, normal merges `a9817b05` of historical main `48bd1982`, `c6c5ea3` of historical #245 main `0e058804`, and `98969765` of historical #247 main `07a3d483`, and exact `d38d41f`/`a2002c3c`/`a7506a01`/`3c156065`/`a10bad90`/`80741157` review outcomes are recorded above; technical Sol returned `CLEAN` for published `bc305778`; `3c156065` was non-final, `a10bad90` is a correction-review source, and `80741157` is the publication-reconciliation source; older packet hashes are invalidated.
- `NOW:` PR #246's current head must match a recorded exact-reviewed SHA. Before publication, re-fetch `origin/main` and verify it descends from bootstrap floor `d787b7e0e1c9cb5eb85c86b448e68b1ca43fce9c`. Required PR checks and CodeRabbit resolution are pre-merge gates. Trusted-workflow/ruleset activation and post-activation proof are immediate post-merge gates before any later PR or private-sheet review. Mason must not begin private-sheet review.
- `REMAINING:` protected PR #246 acceptance after all those gates, then Mason's row-by-row private-sheet review and explicit approval of the exact aggregate-bound packet. Any future model alias must record its resolved model truthfully; the accepted review must remain bound to the current PR head.
- `GUARD:` no Stage C SQL/migration/apply, live mutation, flag enablement, deploy, or merge is authorized by this packet record.
- `NEEDS MASON:` no action until the external gates complete; afterward, row-by-row private-sheet review and explicit packet approval.
- `VERDICT:` PARKED — PR #246 OPEN; CURRENT HEAD MUST MATCH A RECORDED EXACT-REVIEWED SHA, REQUIRED CHECKS/CODERABBIT, AND EXTERNAL TRUSTED-WORKFLOW/RULESET ACTIVATION PLUS PROOF PENDING

## Status update 2026-09-26 (docs cleanup)

- `STATUS:` COMPLETE — ledger closed. PR #246 merged 2026-07-28; Stage C landed via PR #282 (merged 2026-07-29) and migration `20260729213733_supplier_pricing_phase3c_return_policy_classification` is in the live ledger. The PARKED verdict above is the 2026-07-27 state.
