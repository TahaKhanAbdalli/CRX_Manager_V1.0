# Known Issues — what is open today

**Last verified: 2026-10-27 (America/Chicago)** for KI-12 and KI-81 (live function bodies and quote rows read
2026-10-25, re-read 2026-10-26 13:33 UTC and 2026-10-27 05:06 UTC, 12:06 AM Central: the six bodies migration
`20261027040000` pins are unchanged, no quote is sent or revised, and no migration since touches the functions these
entries name; at 7:37 AM Central that migration applied live, ledger `20261027123725`, 1068 rows, and a read-only
read after the apply found the save, convert, draw-down and Schedule Job bodies calling its price check); the
migration ledger re-read by the PR #1138 session at 5:05 AM Central after its apply (1067 rows, newest
`20261027093945` = `20261027030000_customer_credit_exposure`, row 991) and at 12:05 AM Central (newest `20261027044721`,
then `20261027020546` = part B, consistent with KI-01 and KI-73); 2026-10-26 for KI-01 and KI-73 (row 11.4 part B, checked 9:05 PM Central,
PR #1103): after part B (`20261026050000`, ledger `20261027020546`) applied live, the `_can_see_field` body md5,
the field-table SELECT policies and the per-role visible-field counts were re-read live read-only (the ledger then
had 1065 rows). PR #1114 (To-Do 0.15) re-read the `email_type` enum and
`vendors` emails read-only on 2026-10-26 (10 values; 0 of 13 vendors with an email) for the KI-72 PO-email note;
its row 995 `20261027070000` is not yet applied. The
rest of the file was last verified 2026-10-25 against `main` at `c65b7b351` (code, migration files, merged PRs).
The 2026-10-23 rewrite had no database access. The 2026-10-25 pass re-read live, read-only, at 10:52 PM Central:
the migration ledger from `20261022000000` on (so the applied-live claims for `20261022090000`, `20261022101000`
and `20261023090000` in KI-01, KI-02, KI-73 and KI-74 are confirmed), the KI-07 grant and search-path items, and the
`invoice_postable_version` overload. Every other "applied live" statement below is still the older record's claim,
marked as such. The margin-floor PR (To-Do 0.2) re-read the ledger again on 2026-10-26 (newest rows
`20261023100000` and `20261023090000`), consistent with KI-01.

This file is the short list of things that are genuinely open, or that someone decided to live with. Everything
else (fixed, merged, retired, long write-ups, the evidence trail, old section numbers like §0d, §4b, F06) is
preserved word for word in
[`docs/manual/archive/KNOWN_ISSUES-history-2026-10.md`](archive/KNOWN_ISSUES-history-2026-10.md)
(the whole previous file, ~7,000 lines, unchanged). Comments in code or docs that cite an old section number
resolve there.

**How to read an entry.** *Severity* is HIGH / MED / LOW. *Area* groups the list. *Owner* is a named person only
where a record says so; "unassigned" means nobody is working on it. "Mason decision" means the fix is waiting on
a business or risk call that only he can make. *Status* is one of:
**OPEN** (confirmed still present on `main`), **PARTIAL** (some of it fixed, the rest open),
**ACCEPTED** (Mason decided to live with it; reason given), **UNVERIFIED** (could not be confirmed either way in
this pass; treat as open until someone checks).

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| Open or partly open entries (KI-01 to KI-52, KI-72 to KI-78 and KI-81; several bundle related small items; includes the entries or sub-items marked UNVERIFIED) | 49 |
| Accepted by Mason (KI-60 to KI-71, KI-79, KI-80) | 14 |
| Closed as FIXED during this rewrite, with proof (bottom of file) | 6 |

Highest-priority open items, in order: KI-01 (an applicator keeps field access after the assignment ends,
part C; the functions and tables were fixed live 2026-10-26 and 2026-10-27 UTC, parts A and B), KI-02 (cost and
margin: the table-level lock is live since 2026-10-25; the server-function audit is still owed), KI-10 (about 69 functions still replay a saved answer on the retry
key alone), KI-04 (tools with no permission rule run without a prompt), KI-18 (UTC/browser-clock season can
suppress the pre-harvest safety warning).

## Security and access

### KI-01 — Drivers and applicators can read every customer's fields and some money totals
**HIGH · PARTIAL · security · Mason approval needed to narrow permissions; parts A and B applied live, part C not started**
Until 2026-10-26 02:10 UTC (9:10 PM Central, 2026-10-25), any signed-in account, including drivers and applicators, could call database functions that
returned every customer's field boundaries, owners, billing splits, balances and the company-wide overdue list,
because the functions never checked who was asking. Until 2026-10-27 02:05 UTC (9:05 PM Central, 2026-10-26),
applicators could also read every field-table row, not only the fields of the jobs they were sent to. Proven by
read-only impersonation on 2026-10-22. Planned as three parts: A (functions, PR #1065), B (tables, PR #1103),
C (the job route); A and B are applied live and merged; part C has no PR. Related lows: dispatched
applicators can read chemical cost; any sales rep can edit another rep's draft field-invoice billing; invoice
emails put the invoice number and date into HTML unescaped (`src/lib/emailService.ts:123-139`).
Status 2026-10-23: part A was written and not yet applied (`20261023090000_field_functions_require_field_access`,
history row 980). It adds `_can_see_field`, filters the two field-map lookups by it, makes the other field and money
functions office-only (plus three uncalled ones the review found), and was proven in a disposable copy of the
schema (`scripts/smoke/prove-field-functions-require-field-access-real-schema.mjs`): each applicator sees only
its assigned fields, everyone else none, office staff unchanged.
Status 2026-10-26: part A is APPLIED LIVE (02:10:16 UTC, 9:10 PM Central on 2026-10-25; ledger `20261026021016`,
history row 980) on Mason's own `I approve`, and PR #1065 merged as `9ad2cb000`. Re-checked live (read-only
impersonation, counts only): the real applicator gets 2 fields from the field-map lookup (its 2 open dispatches;
it was 5) and is refused the all-fields map; a driver gets 0; an admin gets all 5. Still open: the applicator
reads all 5 rows of the `fields` table directly (part B), and the whole-job applicator route has no end (part
C, KI-73). No in-app click-through as an applicator was done.
Status 2026-10-26 (Central): part B is APPLIED LIVE (2026-10-27 02:05:46 UTC, 9:05 PM Central on 2026-10-26;
ledger `20261027020546`, history row 985) on Mason's own `I approve`, and PR #1103 merged as `5d8af90c1`.
Re-checked live read-only: `_can_see_field` md5 matches the migration's postflight pin, and the field-table
SELECT policies gate applicators on it. Visible `fields` rows per role, computed from the live policy rules with
each active person's id substituted (not a signed-in test): admins (4) 5 of 5, sales reps (3) 5 of 5, the 1
active applicator 2 of 5 (the fields of the jobs they are dispatched to; it was 5), drivers (2) 0, entity
recipients (2) 0. Still open: access does not end when the assignment ends (part C, KI-73). No in-app
click-through as an applicator was done. Part B also widened `_can_see_field` to every field of a dispatched job,
so the earlier gap where an applicator sent to one field of a split job got no weather centroid on Job Detail
should be gone (not checked in the app; 0 split assignments live, 2026-10-22).

### KI-02 — Product cost and margin: server functions not yet fully audited
**MED · PARTIAL · security/money · follow-up audit unassigned**
Mason decided cost and margin are admin-only. Screens and report functions were changed (migrations
`20261019010000`, `20261019230000`) and purchase-order cost is locked (`20261021140000`, `20261021141000`,
PR #980). **The column lock is live:** `20261022101000_cost_columns_admin_only` (PR #1089, applied 2026-10-25
22:34 UTC on Mason's in-chat approval, ledger `20261025223447`). Neither signed-in users (`authenticated`, admins
included) nor signed-out visitors (`anon`) can read or write a cost, profit or margin column directly on
`products`, `quotes`, `quote_items`, `quote_versions`, `orders`, `order_items`, `invoices`, `invoice_items`, `jobs`,
`job_chemicals`, `blend_ticket_products` or `commissions` (read live after the apply: 0 of 30 such columns readable
by either role; the server-only `service_role` key is unchanged); admins read cost through `get_admin_cost_fields`.
Two residuals stay accepted by Mason (2026-10-21): commission amount and rate together imply profit, and below-cost
refusals let a rep narrow a cost by trial and error. Includes the older sub-items "reps can recover
application-service cost" and "retire the old `admin_set_application_service_cost` function" (no caller left in
`src/`; no DROP migration exists).
Still open (Mason, 2026-10-25, kept out of the column lock): column grants cannot limit owner-rights (SECURITY
DEFINER) functions. The 45 signed-in-executable ones whose body names a cost field were read live on 2026-10-25,
but 22 more that reach cost only through inner helper functions (`create_quote_version`, `save_invoice`,
`price_order`, `save_job` and others) are not yet traced, nor are definer functions that serialize a whole row to
JSON (`to_jsonb`/`row_to_json`), and nothing re-checks function bodies after a later change. Owed: audit those call
chains, and add a standing DB invariant sweep that flags any signed-in-executable function returning cost, profit or
margin to a non-admin. The same follow-up makes the cost-lock proof script record each ledger-only migration once
(CodeRabbit, PR #1089).

### KI-03 — Reps do not yet have the decided invoice and commission-split scoping
**MED · OPEN · security/money · Mason decided, build unassigned**
Mason decided reps may see all invoices read-only but only act on their own, and that only admins may change
commission splits on jobs, quotes and orders. Neither is built: no migration widens rep invoice reads or adds
own-name checks (`INVOICE_SCOPE_DENIED`) to the full set of invoice actions any active rep can call today on any
invoice id: `unpost_invoice`, `unpost_invoice_group`, `transfer_invoice_to_job`, `consolidate_draft_invoices`,
`update_field_app_applied_info`, `update_field_app_invoice_billing`, `save_field_app_invoice` (existing invoice) and
the `invoice_shares_insert` policy (checked live 2026-10-13: no ownership test); screens must also hide Edit/Post
on other reps' invoices, and payments and prepay/credit application stay open to reps. Any rep can
still change a commission split on a job, quote or order (only the customer default is protected). Any rep can
also roll over any rep's quote.

### KI-04 — Connected tools with no permission rule run without a prompt
**HIGH · PARTIAL · tooling-guards/security · unassigned**
`.claude/hooks/migration-apply-guard.mjs:59` answers "allow" for every connected tool except migration apply, so
any connector tool without an explicit ask/deny rule runs without confirmation. Vercel deploy tools and Supabase
secret/branch tools were covered in PR #940; the email-send tool and any connector added later are not (no rule
in `.claude/settings.json`; a user-level rule was not checked). Two smaller hook gaps from closed PR #605 remain.

### KI-05 — A sales rep can write RUP register rows for an invoice that was never posted
**MED · OPEN · security/money · unassigned**
`generate_rup_sales_records` (latest body `20260707040000`) checks the caller's role but not that the invoice is
posted, so a rep can add restricted-use-pesticide register rows for a draft. PR #927 hid register reads from
reps but explicitly left this function unchanged. Live had 0 register rows when last checked (older record's claim).

### KI-06 — Financial audit log can point at hard-deleted records
**HIGH (per older record) · UNVERIFIED · database/money · Mason (migration decision)**
Some audit-trail rows refer to invoices or payments that were later hard-deleted and carry no snapshot of what
the record was. Newer invoice deletes are soft; hard-delete paths for payments and the admin override remain.
No snapshot/guard migration was found, but the live row count could not be checked.

### KI-07 — Other small security gaps
**MED/LOW · mixed · unassigned**
- `profiles` still grants `TRUNCATE`/`TRIGGER` to signed-in users (no revoking migration found; confirmed live
  read-only 2026-10-25 with `has_table_privilege('authenticated', ...)`) — OPEN, LOW-MED.
- Customer-document post-apply check (browser storage policies removed, Documents tab still works) was never
  recorded; and a removed document cannot be reopened even by an admin — UNVERIFIED, LOW.
- Three older "reps work any customer" leftovers: signed-in rep click-through of `customer-document-files`
  still owed — LOW.
- A staff viewer can mint a temporary photo link (Mason accepted this, see accepted list KI-60).
- 12 live SECURITY DEFINER functions set `search_path` to `public, extensions, pg_temp`, which the written rule
  (`public, pg_temp`, or an exactly empty path with fully-qualified names) does not cover: `fields_acre_authority_guard`,
  `find_overlapping_fields`, `get_field_dashboard`, `get_field_geojson`, `get_fields_geojson_by_ids`,
  `get_fields_with_geojson`, `get_job_fields_with_geojson`, `get_job_proof_data`, `save_field_geometry`,
  `save_field_polygons`, `set_field_boundary`, `set_field_override_acres` (read-only `execute_sql`, 2026-10-26 UTC; same 12 re-read
  2026-10-25 10:52 PM Central).
  They need `extensions` for PostGIS. Either document a PostGIS exception to the rule or schema-qualify the
  PostGIS calls and drop `extensions` from the path. Promised to CodeRabbit on PR #1065 (thread 4373018174) — LOW.

## Money

### KI-10 — About 69 live functions replay a saved result matched on the retry key alone
**HIGH on money paths · PARTIAL · money/inventory/database · unassigned (batch 3 remainder is next)**
When a user retries an action with a saved "retry key", these functions return the first call's saved answer
without checking that the retry is for the same person and record. Nothing is double-charged; a reused key with
a different target gives a false "success" on the wrong record. Fixed on `main`: batch 1 (`20261016060000`,
PR #942), batch 2 (`20261016140000`, PR #951), batch 3a (`20261019200000`, PR #954), batch 3b (`20261019235000`,
PR #967). Remaining: `unpost_invoice`, `price_order`, `update_order_items`, `save_field_app_invoice`, rebate
claims, `close_accounting_period`, notification RPCs and about 55 MED/LOW functions (batch 4). No open PR.
Batch 4 includes `mark_inventory_row_verified` (MED, added 2026-10-23, PR #1042 follow-up 3; Mason: "batch it"):
it matches its saved result on key and operation only, so a reused key with a different `p_inventory_id`, or from
another admin, returns the first call's result. `IntegrityCleanupPanel.tsx` mints a fresh key per click, so no
screen reaches it today. Fix with the batch wrapper as in `20261016140000`, with a real-schema prover.

### KI-11 — Browser screens throw away or share their retry key (double-apply risk)
**HIGH on money paths · PARTIAL · money · unassigned**
On a lost reply the app should retry with the same key. Many screens discard the key too early or keep it across
different records, so a retry could double-apply or replay another record's result. About 14 spots were fixed
(PR #584); a dozen-plus remain (`KNOWN_UNFIXED_SITES` in `src/__tests__/idempotency-reset-order.test.ts:246`:
JobDetail, QuoteBuilder, BlendTicketDetail, PrepayWorkspacePanel, FinanceChargePreviewModal and others). The
`PrepaymentManagerPanel` item may now be covered server-side by KI-10 batch 1 (not confirmed). The automatic
scanner for this is acknowledged as a weak tripwire.

### KI-12 — Quote "Convert to Order" can leave an accepted quote with no order
**MED (latent) · CAUSE FIXED, LIVE 2026-10-27 (To-Do 1.3; PR #1105 merged as `f1503ba91`) · money/inventory/UI · Mason to decide about one real accepted quote with no order (Q-2026-2059)**
QuoteBuilder used to save the quote as Accepted (releasing its inventory holds) before creating the order, so a
failed second step left an accepted quote with no order. It now calls `convert_quote_to_order` on the sent or
revised quote, which marks it accepted in the same transaction as the order; a failure leaves the quote as it was
(proof: `scripts/smoke/smoke-convert-sent-quote-in-one-step.sql`). A direct `quotes.status` update by an owning
rep can still flip a quote to accepted without an order (the column is writable); that path is not in the app.
Q-2026-2059 (accepted, no order, no draws; seen 2026-10-25) predates the fix and is untouched.
**The December pre-booking flow had the same gap** (raised by Maksym, checked in the code 2026-10-26): a
Planned Program quote reserves its stock with holds (`create_planned_holds`), and the trigger
`release_holds_on_quote_status_change` (latest in `20260706030000`) frees every active hold when the status becomes
Accepted. The same fix covers it: whole Convert to Order and Book as Order both now reach `convert_quote_to_order`
with no Accepted save first, so the hold release and the new order are one transaction and a failed conversion
keeps the pre-booked stock reserved. Partial Order (`draw_down_quote`) never flipped the status first. Two small database clean-ups (extra `quote_sections` privileges and a loose
`_below_cost_reason_from_json` parser) and a display-only profit mismatch are also recorded; the fixes exist only
on closed PR #397.

### KI-13 — Returns never reduce already-earned commission; commission rules unbuilt
**MED · OPEN · money · Mason decision exists (2026-08-09), not built**
Commission clawback on returns has no function or migration on `main`. Also open: `commission_payments.total_amount`
is stored as dollars with decimals (checks force clean cents, but the column breaks the integer-cents rule;
MED); two money columns (`commissions_order_profit_whole_cents_chk`, `quotes_total_cost_whole_cents_chk`) can still
hold sub-cent values, adding the checks is Mason's call (LOW-MED); the old name-reuse guard trigger
`trg_guard_recipient_name_reuse` is deliberately kept until all app versions send person IDs, so renaming someone
can make old splits refuse to save (LOW-MED).

### KI-14 — Transfer-created field invoices are always Net 30
**MED · OPEN · money · unassigned**
`20260914100500` lines ~2587 and 2820 stamp invoice date + 30 days regardless of the customer's terms. The post
path was not traced.

### KI-15 — Reports > Profitability reads stored order profit, not the server report
**MED · OPEN · money/UI · unassigned**
`src/pages/Reports.tsx:299-375` computes margins in the browser from `orders.total_profit` / `order_items.profit`;
the server report `get_profitability_report` (cost at time of sale) has no caller. Numbers can differ.

### KI-16 — Sub-cent and rounding gaps
**MED/LOW · mixed · money · unassigned**
- `baseUnitOfRate` (`src/lib/chemCalculator.ts:559`) drops everything after `/`, so "oz/cwt" reads as "oz".
  Saving a job with such a unit is refused by the database (`20260820120000`, PR #446, applied live per the older
  record); `_close_quote_as_applied`, the recipe-pricing path and the blend-ticket path (refuses only at billing)
  can still create such lines. MED.
- A zero-width character pasted into a rate unit makes a blend ticket un-invoiceable (fails closed; staff must
  retype). `normalize_rate_unit` does not strip invisible characters. LOW-MED.
- A job chemical line's per-unit COST is still rounded to whole cents when it is converted from the product's
  stock unit to the rate's unit (`reconcileChemAutofillUnits`, and `save_job`'s cost fill in `20261019230000`):
  $5/GAL is 3.90625¢/oz, saved as 4¢, so 400 oz shows $16.00 of cost against $15.625 and the job's margin is off
  by that much. The PRICE is no longer rounded (2026-10-23: left blank unless exact). Cost is not billed. LOW-MED.
- Split-acre shares are rounded to 2 decimals, so totals can differ from the field's acres by cents. UNVERIFIED
  (current body of `derive_customer_shares_from_fields` not located).
- Quote Builder's line math (`recalcItem`, `catalogPricePerAcre` in `src/lib/quoteCalc.ts`) multiplies and rounds
  in dollars, not integer cents. Found by CodeRabbit on PR #1078 (2026-10-23) and deferred: moving it to cents
  changes rounding on every quote line, so it needs its own money PR. LOW.

### KI-17 — Blend-ticket linkage picks one order line per product
**MED · PARTIAL · money · automatic matching unassigned**
`link_blend_ticket_to_order` still takes `ORDER BY sort_order, id LIMIT 1`. The invoice side now refuses to guess
when tier prices differ and asks staff to pick (PRs #982, #995, #1020). Automatic matching or splitting across
tiers is not built; the linkage field is not used for money today.

### KI-18 — Dates and seasons follow the UTC clock or the browser clock
**MED (safety path) / LOW · OPEN · money/UI · unassigned (fix the JobDetail one first)**
- Quote, order and rebate-claim numbers take their year from UTC (`generate_quote_number`, `generate_order_number`,
  `create_rebate_claim`); on 31 Dec 6 pm–midnight Chicago they get next year's number. Cosmetic. LOW.
- `invoices.season` defaults to `current_season()` = UTC date, and the blend-ticket path uses it
  (`20261020210000:1050,1227`): about five hours each 30 Sept evening can stamp the next season. LOW.
- Client season reads use the browser clock (`src/utils/season.ts:14`). The important one is the pre-harvest-
  interval warning in `src/pages/JobDetail.tsx:1449`: a wrong season at the 1 October boundary can silently
  suppress the warning. MED (safety).
- Two AR-aging views bucket a 30-day-old invoice differently; invoice dates have no future-date limit; three
  filters cut the day at UTC midnight. UNVERIFIED (PR #991 fixed the AR strip; the rest not re-checked). MED.

### KI-19 — Accounting-month close: 26 other callers lack the month lock
**HIGH-risk lane, dormant · PARTIAL · money · unassigned**
Vendor-bill and vendor-payment edits are safe against a close (`20260730114102`, `20260730124308`,
`20260731001654`). About 26 other `check_period_open` callers do not take the same lock, so a simultaneous edit
could slip past a close. No month is closed live (older record's claim), so it is dormant.

### KI-20 — Shelved or disabled money features
**MED · OPEN · money · unassigned / Mason**
- Prepay bulk-apply is hard-disabled with `PREPAY_BULK_APPLY_DISABLED` (`20260620200000`) because it could
  double-spend credits; real fix needs the shelved redesign. Per-invoice apply works.
- The earmark engine (`docs/roadmap/shelved-earmark-engine/`) is shelved for a full redesign (Mason, 2026-06-14);
  do not apply.
- Split billing: per-delivery split of a partly delivered order is blocked by independent rounding losing cents
  (Goal 3 pieces landed in PR #1010, per-delivery case not confirmed). UNVERIFIED. Negative-quantity credits and
  reopening a saved split set are not supported (fail closed). LOW.
- Auto-draft invoice does nothing when an applicator completes a job; policy is Mason's, switch is off. MED, dormant.
- Two commission design choices wait on Mason (do blend tickets create commissions; may applicators see a job's
  commission split). UNVERIFIED, LOW.

### KI-81 — Two invoice paths read a quote line's current price, not the price the customer was sent
**MED · OPEN (found 2026-10-25, To-Do 1.2 follow-up) · money · unassigned**
The sent-price lock (`20261027040000`, live since 2026-10-27, ledger `20261027123725`) gates Convert, Partial Order and Schedule Job, which copy quote prices into
orders and job lines. Two later paths read `quote_items.price_per_unit` live instead (read from live bodies
2026-10-25): `create_invoice_from_blend_ticket` (through `set_blend_ticket_product_quote_price` /
`_blend_quote_pick_valid_20261020`, or the first line of the job's quote section) and the field-application
invoice (`_save_field_app_invoice_impl_20260714`, `resolve_field_app_chemical_price`, which take the first quote
line on the field with no status, customer or deleted filter). After a revision that changed a price and was not
re-sent, either can bill the unsent price; the field-application lookup can also take a draft, declined or deleted
quote's price. Fix: read the price from the version last sent (or refuse like the lock), with a real-schema proof.

## Inventory and deliveries

### KI-25 — A customer receipt that fails to send after a delivery completion is not retried
**MED · OPEN (deliberately deferred) · UI/database · unassigned (next Goal 5/6 change)**
After completion the phone sends the receipt email. If signal drops between, the delivery is complete with no
receipt; the driver is warned and the office can resend by hand. A queue table plus scheduled sender was designed
and not built (needs a new Edge Function deploy). No `delivery_receipt_queue` exists in `supabase/`.

### KI-26 — Delivery completion-evidence leftovers
**LOW · OPEN · UI/database/process · Mason for the access-policy item**
Following `20261022075000` (PR #1024): old app versions are refused until reloaded; offline completions queued
before the change go to review; old completed deliveries have no proof stored; some old proof scripts fail;
abandoned signature files stay stored; file contents are not inspected. Owed: a real-phone airplane-mode test, and
Mason's approval to narrow four older signature policies.

### KI-27 — An expired uncertain request locks its dialog
**MED · OPEN · UI/inventory · unassigned (PR #624 closed)**
If a stock receive/adjust or vendor-bill save loses its reply and 23 hours pass, the dialog locks in that browser
with a "do not submit again" message and no way to dismiss it (`src/hooks/useUncertainMutationIntent.ts:69`). Fix
is an admin-only "I checked, clear this" control.

### KI-28 — Jobs assigned to a non-applicator never reach the dispatch board
**MED · OPEN · database · unassigned**
The sync triggers (`20260707020000:231,296`) require an active applicator; re-activating the person later does not
add the job back. A detection sweep exists (`scripts/db-invariant-sweeps/predicates/dispatch-sync-nonqualifying-profile.sql`);
the write-path fix is not built. Older record counted 0 missing rows live.

### KI-29 — Field-mode and inventory data decisions waiting on Mason
**LOW-MED · UNVERIFIED · inventory/process · Mason**
Five products still flag until counted (Mason chose not to count); returns/voids on Chem Man-billed deliveries stay
allowed; six partially fulfilled orders and three stuck deliveries need a business call; 19 negative inventory rows
must only be fixed from physical counts; the Order page still offers whole-order invoicing on 33 orders (server
refuses, no double bill); live-data cleanups (eight SEED commission batches, PO-2026-0008/0015, an E2E zero-item
invoice, five empty deliveries). Counts are older records' claims, not re-measured.

### KI-30 — Customer/vendor/product data hygiene waiting on Mason
**LOW-MED · UNVERIFIED · database/process · Mason / unassigned**
Vendor-name merges, a 19-product category remap and ~20 junk-row deletes need his decisions (each changes history
or deletes real rows). About 105 of 204 stored EPA registration numbers are wrong (MED, compliance data; the
`LabelDataQuality` screen exists, data entry is not done). CRM has no data entered; 146 of 150 customers lack a
sales rep (older counts).

### KI-31 — Field Setup and field-save loose ends
**LOW · OPEN · UI/database · unassigned**
After saving a boundary the page does not refresh total acres, so a later attribute-only save can revert legacy
acres; deleting every drawn polygon of a multi-part field falls back to the old boundary
(`src/pages/FieldSetup.tsx:572`). `save_field` reports success for a missing id (`20260729222311:80`, no `FOUND`
check).

### KI-32 — Scale limits: some lists and pickers are still row-capped
**MED · PARTIAL · UI/database · Mason (Goal 4)**
Most lists now page through every row (PRs #959, #1017, #1048). The order, job and purchase-order pickers now search
the database, and cycle-count locations read every row (PR #1048). Still capped: Customers (1000), Jobs (500),
Crop Programs (500), Dispatch Board (500); a Jobs `.or(id.in)` URL-size risk; the blend-ticket scanner Edge
Function (needs a deploy). Per the PR #1048 note, also left for later: the Invoice Detail customer picker and Bulk
PO Import products (open PRs #1018/#1021 at the time), Label Data Quality, Product Detail choice lists, bulk import
name matching, and the Field Customer Assignment dropdown. A customer-name search looks through only the first 50
matching customers (alphabetical) without saying so. Past a cap, a record cannot be chosen.

## Database and release process

### KI-35 — Live ledger vs files on `main` is checked only by noticing
**MED · UNVERIFIED · process/database · unassigned**
Nothing automatically compares migrations applied live with migration files on `main` (four past mismatches). The
live ledger also has older entries with no file (ACCEPTED, pre-existing drift; see KI-62).

### KI-36 — A table lock does not serialize the OLD body of a replaced function
**MED (rule) · ACCEPTED as guidance (same as KI-61) · database · Mason (2026-09-03)**
See KI-61. The rule is not yet in the migration checklist (`docs/workflows`); it lives only in the archive entry.

### KI-37 — Parked migration draft with a fragile membership rule
**LOW · OPEN · database · unassigned**
Parked draft `20260813060000_require_completed_delivery_before_invoice_post` (staging folder, history row 877,
NOT APPLIED) selects functions by searching their body for the word "posted", which in one function is only in a
comment. Nothing is wrong today because it is unapplied.

### KI-38 — Edge Function error alerting fails quiet
**LOW · OPEN · tooling/process · Mason (deploy approval)**
`supabase/functions/_shared/sentry.ts:60` defines `validateSentryDsnOrThrow()` but nothing calls it; a missing key
logs `[SENTRY_MISCONFIG]` and drops the alert. Failing loudly needs the key confirmed and eight function deploys.

### KI-39 — Customer-facing PDF polish
**LOW · OPEN · UI · unassigned**
Long section notes on quote PDFs overprint the items table (`src/lib/quotePdf.ts:190-191`); the year-over-year
"Change" colour in the year-end PDF never shows (`src/lib/yearEndSummaryPdf.ts:295`).

### KI-40 — CRM Phase 5 (AI receptionist) preconditions
**LOW · OPEN (future work) · database · unassigned**
Five prerequisites before building an automated phone receptionist (service-callable customer summary, service
document ingestion, provenance-trigger handling, transcript purge, a citing design question). Not a live defect.

### KI-41 — Product roadmap items deliberately deferred
**LOW · OPEN · process · unassigned**
Grower portal; OCR auto-fill of re-entry/pre-harvest intervals (held back as a compliance risk); offline-recovery
items (photo/signature persistence, idempotent email replay) and a real-phone offline test (MED, UNVERIFIED).

---

## Tooling, guards and CI (affect the agents and the build, not customers)

### KI-45 — A helper agent's report can latch, or clear, the hold
**MED · OPEN · tooling-guards · unassigned**
The hook that freezes outward actions when Mason says "stop" can mistake a helper's report containing that word
for his own words (`.claude/hooks/prompt-source-lib.mjs`, text-shape rules only). The complete fix needs Claude
Code to pass message origin.

### KI-46 — A review proof can be rewritten through its Windows 8.3 short name
**MED · OPEN · tooling-guards/security · Mason (owner action)**
The saved "Sol review passed" file can be addressed via an old-style short name the guard does not recognise.
Turning off short names is a reversible system change that only Mason should make; the durable fix is to
authenticate proof contents. CodeRabbit's backstop was removed 2026-10-19, which raises exposure.

### KI-47 — Hook bypasses that remain
**MED/LOW · mixed · tooling-guards · unassigned**
- Autopilot approves these destructive spellings (`.claude/hooks/autopilot-lib.mjs:214-216`; reproduced by calling
  `autopilotDecision`, re-confirmed by a reviewer): `rm -Rf`, `rm -r -f`, `rm --recursive --force`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse`, `git clean --force -d`, `git branch -d -f` and `git commit -n`. A fix sits on branch
  `claude/autopilot-recursive-delete-alias-20260907` (18,131-command sweep) but must be rebuilt on current `main`.
  MED.
- A `[E2E]` marker exempts a whole SQL batch (`.claude/hooks/live-testdata-lib.mjs:731`). MED.
- Bare `git clean` with a config override is not covered (`bash-safety-lib.mjs:280`). LOW.
- `review-proof-guard`: the `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` separate-export form and `gh` download over a protected path are
  unblocked (item 1 fixed in PR #530). Capped by Mason's 2026-09-01 decision. LOW.
- `git config core.hooksPath` is now refused by the Claude hook (#530) but the Codex side and a CI assertion are
  missing; CI still blocks anything reaching `main`. MED.
- The push guard does not treat `core.hooksPath` or shell-form `credential.helper` as dangerous
  (`codex-push-lib.mjs:1209-1217`). MED.
- `stop-verify` PROOF matching is text-based, so a fabricated PROOF line passes. LOW.
- Nine enforcement-file patterns are missing from the `.claude/settings.json` `ask` list (F3). Probably
  superseded by Mason's "fewer prompts" direction (#956, #974); needs a decision to close or cut down. LOW.

### KI-48 — Migration-apply protections and checks with known holes
**HIGH (per older record, exposure reduced) · OPEN · tooling-guards · Mason (capped review loop)**
- Ahead-of-pending marker (parked after review round 12): the proof-folder scan in `migration-apply-lib.mjs:956-975`
  has no deadline, so a slow run past the hook limit could let an apply proceed unchecked; the marker is not bound
  to a file digest. Exposure reduced because applies go through the guarded script.
- Three apply protections exist only on closed PR #364's branch. OPEN.
- The migration-ordering check reads a local snapshot of applied migrations and cannot see applies from another
  checkout (`applied-snapshot-invalidate.mjs`); Supabase's ledger is the backstop. LOW-MED.
- The migration-drift reviewer's overload check sees only authored history, not the live catalog
  (`.claude/agents/migration-drift-reviewer.md` CHECK 2). Deferred by Mason. MED.
- Whole-body hash pins on the quote-version trust chain must be updated in three files together (ACCEPTED, KI-63).

### KI-49 — Codex review tooling
**HIGH (per older record), mitigated · OPEN · tooling-guards/process · wiring a hook needs Mason's approval**
Running raw `codex review <scope>` from the repo root self-recurses, kills its own process and exits 0, which can
record a false "clean" review; the wrapper `node scripts/write-codex-push-proof.mjs` avoids it, nothing blocks the
raw form. Also: the Codex `/import` feature writes corrupted `source-command-*` adapters (commit blocker fixed,
importer cannot be turned off; Mason: keep visible, do not delete); `sync-agent-workflows.mjs` has thirteen
recorded limitations (lexical-only containment, junction/symlink and path-case edge cases; Mason: record, don't
patch); the guard-claim ratchet misses claims inside template strings and files outside the hook folders.

### KI-50 — Cloud (web/mobile) sessions cannot push or back up memory
**MED · ACCEPTED · tooling-guards · Mason (2026-08-04: leave as is)**
A credential proxy rewrites git addresses and the guards refuse (safe failure); deliver from the cloud with GitHub
tools. `scripts/backup-claude-memory.mjs:476` refuses the same way.

### KI-51 — Supplier-pricing Phase 3C containment and time-bombs
**MED · OPEN · tooling-guards · unassigned**
The trusted containment check is not a required check on `main` (rules: Vercel, Lint/Type/Test/Build, SQL
Migration Validation). The first-push ancestry cap is 4,096 commits (`scripts/check-supplier-pricing-phase3-private-artifacts.mjs:25`);
`main` has 3,032 and grows ~200/month, so about five months until every new branch push is blocked; raise it before
then. Byte/candidate scan budgets (3 GiB, 100,000) need re-measuring. Maintenance watch.

### KI-52 — Tests and tooling hygiene
**LOW · OPEN · tooling-guards · unassigned**
Page-render tests flake in the full suite (latest fix #1062; fixed case by case); `scripts/fleet-status.mjs` lacks
the fsmonitor override; `live-testdata-lib.mjs` read-side false positives (UNVERIFIED);
`scripts/land-pr.mjs:167` prints a `gh pr merge --squash --auto` command the merge guard refuses;
`src/lib/rlsContracts.test.ts:148-160` comment still says "NOT APPLIED" for `20260813080000`; the Phase 3
return-policy concurrency prover can't reach its chain (UNVERIFIED); no static guard catches invoice-type leaks or
direct-URL edit-lock bypasses (MED, UI); extra live-sweep predicates (concurrency hotspot, more money identities)
not written; Gauntlet V2 Phase 2 unfinished (no staging database, E2E switched off, 44 page-render skips,
counts not re-measured); `docs/reference/gotchas.md` has no "gross margin means markup" note.
Further small LOW notes from the 2026-10-13 branch salvage, carried from the archive and not re-checked: invoices
created through the order functions would be numbered INV- instead of CS-/MC- (latent; 0 of 12 live order
invoices affected); the smoke chain `smoke-split_invoices_jsonb_fix.sql` is stale; on the bulk order import,
Escape on the below-cost prompt also closes the Import Orders dialog while the upload continues out of sight
(`src/components/orders/BulkOrderImport.tsx`; a fix sits on closed PR #350's branch); the return-credit prover
is pre-apply and two test hardenings were not carried; GraphQL ref updates are not inspected locally (the
server-side ruleset is the boundary).
`src/types/supabase.ts` cannot be swapped wholesale for a fresh live type generation (checked 2026-10-26): the
generator drops hand-kept entries (the `invoice_postable_version` computed field on `invoices_postable`, which
`InvoiceDetail`, `Invoices`, `OfficeCockpit` and `OrderDetail` select; nullable columns on table-returning reports
such as `get_quote_versions`), so the typecheck fails, and it adds about 60 live helpers the file lacks, which
moves two `rpcContracts.test.ts` classifications. Records PRs add only the entries their migration changes, compared
against a live generation.

## Accepted risks (Mason decided to live with these; do not re-open without a new decision)

| ID | What | Why accepted |
|---|---|---|
| KI-60 | A permitted staff member can mint a temporary link to a private photo | Mason, option A, 2026-10-14 |
| KI-61 | A `LOCK TABLE` in a migration does not stop an already-running call of the OLD function body | Mason 2026-09-03; both instances applied with zero activity; future migrations of that shape need a quiet rollout and a concurrency proof |
| KI-62 | Live migration ledger has older entries with no file on `main` | Pre-existing drift, not new |
| KI-63 | Quote-version trust chain is hash-pinned in 3 files (`quote-versions-rpc-owned.sql`, migration `20260826220000`, `quoteVersionWriteBoundary.test.ts`) | Intentional friction; a change must update all three |
| KI-64 | All agents share Mason's admin GitHub identity; the manual merge override is fenced only by command matching | Mason declined a separate non-admin credential twice (2026-09-01) |
| KI-65 | The write-time actor-binding guard is bypassable by design limits | Capped by decision 2026-09-01; real controls are Codex review and post-apply sweeps |
| KI-66 | `review-proof-guard` denies destructive commands that spell out a worktree path | Mason "document, don't fix" 2026-08-20; use relative paths |
| KI-67 | `sync-agent-workflows --write` overwrites an unusable manifest; the `.agents/` drift sweep reads disk, not the git index | Mason 2026-09-03 |
| KI-68 | `adjust_inventory` accepts a retry key with control characters; a suspended second tab can resend a stale batch adjustment | Mason accepted 2026-09-20 / 2026-09-13; no caller can produce it; revisit if duplicate adjustments appear |
| KI-69 | Return-credit behaviours staff will see (late return credits stay in the current season; a funding invoice can't be deleted until the credit is voided) | Mason policy 2026-08-26 |
| KI-70 | Proof-file self-attestation; migration-source provenance closes the quiet path only; shell string-reconstruction bypasses; worktree awareness is a session-start snapshot; `npm --prefix/--workspace` escapes the script-body guard; Edge Functions and ~130 legacy reads exempt from check lint rules | Accepted residuals under the "honest mistakes, not malicious agent" model |
| KI-71 | Renaming/deactivating a profile named in a commission split fails closed; PWA needs two reloads after a deploy; ExcelJS tests slow on a cold cache; JobDetail save test must re-click | Deliberate / expected behaviour |
| KI-79 | A saved quote line forgets whether its acres were typed or filled in from the section's field (`save_quote` stores the acres, not the source; Quote Builder's `acres_source` lives only in the browser). Totals stay correct. After reopening, switching a section's field leaves those lines' acres as they were and shows "This section's saved lines keep their acres. Check them against the new field." Options weighed 2026-10-23: (1) keep as is, no cost; (2) store a typed/field flag on `quote_items`: a migration plus changes to `save_quote` (a money RPC) and every quote-copy path (duplicate, versions, rollover, template), which fall back to today's warning if they drop it; (3) save each line's field link and have the server recompute acres: a large `save_quote` rewrite, highest risk | Mason chose option 1, keep as is (2026-10-23, #1060 follow-up); revisit if reps report wrong acres after switching fields |
| KI-80 | A job line priced from a product's tier price is not re-checked when that tier price is later removed or the customer's tier changes; it is re-checked (`job_chemicals_price_required`, #1060) only when the line is next edited | Mason declined the re-check (2026-10-23, #1060 follow-up): rare case |

## Additional open details (carried from the archive after the Luna cross-check; not re-verified in this pass)

These sub-items belong to the numbered entries above. They were found missing or blurred when a second reviewer
(Luna) compared this file with the old one. Each is an open or accepted limitation as the old file recorded it.

### KI-72 — A fix merged on `main` whose last steps are still pending (moved here from "closed")
**MED · PARTIAL · security/money · Mason**
CRX-LIFE-001, reps creating a `field_application` invoice through the order
pipeline: fix merged (PR #885, `20261006200000`, applied live per the old record). Two proof gates remain: the 29th
live-sweep predicate (`quote-versions-rpc-owned`) was declined at its prompt, and the live smoke chains need
Mason's REAL-DATA-OK.

Purchase order copy (To-Do 0.15, migration `20261027070000`, row 995): the PDF download works once merged,
but **Email PO Copy (to mason@croprxsolutions.com) stays off until Mason approves deploying the `send-email`
edge function** (the live function answers "Unknown email_type: purchase_order").

### KI-73 — More field-access holes (extends KI-01; To-Do row 11.4, plus row 11.7)
**HIGH · PARTIAL · security · Mason approval to narrow permissions**
- FIXED LIVE 2026-10-26 02:10 UTC (9:10 PM Central, 2026-10-25) by part A (PR #1065, history row 980, ledger `20261026021016`): `global_search` let any
  signed-in user search customer names and contacts, order/invoice/delivery numbers and farm names, and
  `get_notes_for_entity` let any signed-in user with a record ID read its team notes. Now search returns nothing
  to field roles and notes follow the linked record (`get_notes_for_entity` runs as the caller, checked live). `team_notes` itself still admits every active profile, so the Team Board shows field roles every note;
  Mason decided 2026-10-23 to keep that for now (To-Do row 11.11, `DECISION_LOG.md`).
- Every active account reads every `customer_addresses` row (To-Do row 11.7; HIGH).
- FIXED LIVE 2026-10-27 02:05 UTC (9:05 PM Central, 2026-10-26) by part B: drivers could read every customer's
  billing splits and spray-record field/acres data through `field_billing_defaults` and
  `application_record_fields` (MED); both now admit only office staff and applicators who can see the field.
- Whole-job applicators keep access to completed, cancelled and soft-deleted jobs indefinitely, and dispatch access
  can survive a job deletion; affected functions include `start_job` and `complete_job` (HIGH; part C, not
  started). Part A's `_can_see_field` already ends whole-job access when `jobs.deleted_at` is set, for the
  field-map lookups only.
- FIXED LIVE 2026-10-27 02:05 UTC (9:05 PM Central, 2026-10-26) by part B (PR #1103, history row 985, ledger
  `20261027020546`): applicators read every `fields` row, and `field_polygons`, crop history, obstacles and
  `field_app_locations` followed the same rule (HIGH; 5 of 5 rows live for the real applicator on 2026-10-25,
  Central). After the apply the 1 active applicator sees 2 of 5 fields, drivers and entity recipients 0, admins
  and sales reps 5 of 5 (computed read-only from the live policy rules, not a signed-in test). Part B also closed: the
  `field_billing_defaults`/`application_record_fields` driver reads above; direct `field_polygons` writes by any
  applicator (made office-only); `field_app_locations`/`_shares` reads (office-only); and
  `get_job_billed_customers` letting any applicator through on a job with no whole-job applicator (NULL gate).
  Mason decided 2026-10-25 that someone sent to a job sees the entire job (`DECISION_LOG.md`), so part B also
  widens `_can_see_field`'s dispatch leg to every field of the dispatched job and keeps the job pages job-wide;
  that resolves the split-job report mismatch a per-field view would have caused. Left after part B: anon reads
  of `application_record_fields` now error instead of returning nothing (LOW, fails closed; three other field
  tables already did); a crew member
  whose role is driver keeps the crew job and its map but not the field tables (by design).
- Opposite gap: dispatch-only applicators cannot read their assigned fields' shares, application records and
  details, attachments, or job-attachment photos (LOW). Mason's 2026-10-25 decision (they see the entire job and
  ticket) means these should be widened to the dispatch route too; not built.

### KI-74 — More cost exposure and prerequisites (extends KI-02)
**HIGH/MED · OPEN · security/money · Mason**
`blend_recipe_items` and cost fields reachable through field-billing and dispatch paths remain readable (HIGH).
Commission amount plus rate can reveal a rep's profit, and Quick Receive reveals which open PO line is cheaper
(MED). The computed field `invoice_post_version` reads the whole invoice row, so revoking invoice columns can break
posting: the cost-column lock must ship with a column-safe version design in the same change (MED). **Done in
`20261022090000` (PR #1057, applied live 2026-10-23):** the version is a computed field, `invoice_postable_version`, on
the `invoices_postable` view (every column but `total_cost_cents`), the seven screens read it there, and the cost lock
(`20261022101000`, applied live 2026-10-25) dropped the `invoices` overload.

### KI-75 — Retry-key detail (extends KI-10, KI-11)
**HIGH on money paths · OPEN · money**
Still on the replay-binding list: `transfer_invoice_to_job`, `update_field_app_invoice_billing`, and the after-lock
race in `apply_credit_memo_to_invoice`. Screen-side: the `PrepaymentManagerPanel` split-check modal, JobDetail
reset-before-call defects the scanner cannot see, and payload-sensitive actions in FieldStop, DeliveryDetail and
OrderDetail.

### KI-76 — Quote, season, invoice and return details (extends KI-12, KI-14, KI-18, KI-20, KI-69)
**MED/LOW · OPEN · money**
- Quote re-save can still be refused when a save both deletes or switches a saved line and adds several new lines
  for the same product (LOW).
- `issue_return_credit` and the delivery-split functions can fall back to `current_season()` (UTC) (LOW).
- `get_customer_summary` and `operational_dashboard_summary` pick the season from the UTC `current_date`, so from 7 PM to midnight Central on 30 September they already count the new season (found by CodeRabbit on PR #1065, 2026-10-25; that PR keeps both bodies as live has them) (LOW).
- Transfer Net 30 (KI-14): the post path was not traced, so a later step might correct it (uncertain).
- Split billing: a split can bill any customer named in editable order allocations, field owners or billing
  defaults; whether that scope is intended is Mason's open decision (MED). Any rep can read another rep's
  split-return lines and prices under `return_items_select` (LOW).
- `create_invoice_from_order` copies a blank unit, so a mono-billed order line with no unit cannot get a return
  credit (MED). A return can go stale after an earlier return is cancelled or rejected (cancel and recreate); a
  concurrent split-invoice void can leave a requested return unreceivable; credits apply manually; multi-price
  billing is credited at an average price (MED, partly by design).
- KI-69 detail: voiding a return credit is not enough; the voided credit memo must be permanently deleted before the
  source invoice can be hard-deleted or re-saved.
- Whole-order invoice quantities and unit prices are not capped server-side (MED). Voiding a delivery whose invoice
  is posted leaves the invoice active; the office must issue a credit memo (MED). Removing a product from a
  scheduled delivery can leave its drafted invoice unpostable, and lowering a quantity leaves the draft over the
  delivery quantity until staff edit it (MED). Freezing a soft-deleted order can block cancelling or voiding its
  completed delivery (reversal needs a reviewed migration) (LOW). Draft invoice CS-2026-0055 is deliberately left
  (the other delivery was billed in Chem Man) (LOW). Integrity checks page by offset, so concurrent inserts or
  deletes can make a run miss or repeat a row (LOW, accepted).

### KI-77 — Lists, UI and CRM details (extends KI-26, KI-30, KI-32, KI-41)
**MED/LOW · OPEN · UI/database**
Still row-capped: the Invoice Detail customer selector, Bulk PO Import products, bulk-import name matching,
Label Data Quality choices, Product Detail choice lists (MED). Paging caveats: two identical reads can still miss
concurrent changes, load/count cost grows on large tables, more than 20 identical-name search results are hard to
reach, a trigram index may be needed (LOW). Commission Payments: an older refresh can report success after a newer
one fails (LOW). `SelectLocationsModal` map/list split stays 50/50 on tablets (LOW). CRM gaps: applicator-license
visibility on customer/prep-card/quote surfaces, a pre-quote pipeline, duplicate-customer detection, bulk
import/assignment of sales reps, outbound-email logging (MED). Offline recovery also lacks notification replay,
operation-specific conflict checks, automatic discovery of an office resolution on the device, a general
duplicate-action policy, and carries the risk of losing device-local work before reconnection (MED). Completion
evidence: photo proof is not tied to who took it, and storage-rule guarantees do not cover dashboard or
service-role tools (LOW).

### KI-78 — Tooling and guard details (extends KI-04, KI-46, KI-47, KI-48, KI-49, KI-50, KI-65, KI-68)
**MED/LOW · OPEN · tooling-guards**
- CodeRabbit label gate (#516), four items: stale requested state can survive an invalid ready event; checks can be
  stale after same-head invalidation; privileged workflow actions use mutable tags; merge guards do not bind
  approval to the recorded request marker or reviewer identity (MED; relevance lowered since CodeRabbit became
  advisory).
- PR #605 hook gaps: MultiEdit edits are not inspected by several hooks; non-canonical path spellings can bypass
  path-rule matching (LOW).
- Review-proof guard: besides the 8.3 short name, an interpreter can build the path, a hard link can expose the file
  outside the state directory, and an alias/junction can be swapped after the check (MED). A separate
  `export GIT_PAGER=...` can evade it, like `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` (LOW).
- The three protections missing from closed PR #364: apply-time one-shot replay enforcement, fresh project-bound
  live evidence, and event-trigger/transitive-fanout coverage (HIGH per the old record, exposure reduced).
- Ahead-of-pending marker: the parked branch's file-digest binding is not rechecked at the end, and three refusal
  tests assert only exit status, so an uncaught crash passes them (LOW).
- Actor-binding guard (accepted, KI-65): hook and live sweeps share naming blind spots; rebinding, dynamic SQL and
  temp-table paths evade checks; helper delegation is not followed; migrations written outside hooked tools bypass
  the hook.
- `sync-agent-workflows.mjs` limits (KI-49): external symlink targets can pass; external `GIT_INDEX_FILE` can be
  ignored; case/Unicode staged paths can evade checks or collide; a directory-to-file change can make repair fail;
  unowned manifest paths can be deleted; fail-closed wiring lacks regression coverage; some prune tests never reach
  the prune loop; `source-command-` is treated as provenance; invalid UTF-8 can compare equal after replacement
  decoding (MED).
- Cloud sessions also fail the commit gates (not only push and backup); the only workaround is unverified (MED, KI-50).
- `inventory.quantity_available` has no CHECK constraint, so a pre-existing NaN can propagate (MED, KI-68). The
  parked control-character migration's postflight checks can be satisfied by a commented-out clause and no longer
  inspect the cutover-trigger body (LOW, only if that branch is resumed).

## Unverified items (could not confirm either way; treat as open until checked)

KI-06 (audit log), KI-07 (customer-document post-apply check), KI-16 (split-acre
rounding), KI-18 (AR-aging parts), KI-20 (per-delivery split, commission design choices), KI-29/KI-30
(live-data counts), KI-35 (ledger reconciliation), KI-41 (offline recovery), KI-52 (prover, live-testdata false
positives). Live-database facts need a read-only query by someone with access.

## Closed in this rewrite (each with proof; full original text is in the archive)

These were open-looking entries in the old file and are confirmed fixed on `main`. "Applied live" is the older
record's claim; this pass had no database access.

1. **Staff photo buckets were publicly readable** — `20261015230000_staff_photo_storage_access.sql` and
   `20261016030000_staff_photo_buckets_private.sql`, PRs #929 and #947 (buckets read `public = false` live
   2026-10-16 per the older record).
2. **Reps could name another salesperson on invoices, orders, blend tickets and quotes** —
   `20261014210000` (PR #928), `20261015130000` (PR #933), `20261015200000` (PR #938).
3. **Free-form invoice could name any product** — `20261021050000_from_scratch_invoices_charge_lines_only`, PR #983.
4. **Split billing could not bill a field owner who is not the order's customer** — `20261021150000` and
   `20261021155000`, PR #1010 (merge `d8dd88a6d`).
5. **Order total overwritten by an unrounded sum in `_update_order_items_impl`** — fixed 2026-08-09; later bodies
   (e.g. `20260914100500:2263`) set the rounded total.
6. **`review-proof-guard` node-preload / `-pe` eval bypass (item 1 of the executor-bypass entry)** — PR #530
   (merge `26e8a40d9`); items 2–3 stay open in KI-47.

Also closed inside the old file's own headings before this rewrite (no new proof needed, see archive): the
Deliveries list scheduled-delivery gap (PR #964), smoke chains rotted by the PO cost lock, the regular invoice
editor posting old amounts, the filed-season date-edit guard, the last commission-cohort migration
`20260914100900`, and the `customer-document-files` v2 redeploy.
