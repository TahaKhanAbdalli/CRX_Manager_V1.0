# Working with Taha

← [[Home]] · see also [[How-to-Use-This-Vault|How to Use This Vault]]

How Mason (owner) and Taha K. (developer) work together on CRX Manager. Mason's own words on how he thinks are at the bottom of [[Goals-and-Vision|Goals and Vision]]. Read that first.

## Who does what

| | Mason | Taha |
|---|---|---|
| **Decides** | What the business needs, priorities, money and risk trade-offs | How to build it: the technical approach, code structure, tools |
| **Owns** | The goals, the [[manual/DECISION_LOG\|Decision Log]], pesticide compliance, inventory readiness, opening balances | The code changes he takes on, their tests, and proof that they work |
| **Approves** | Anything that can't be undone (see below) | His own technical choices, within the rules in this vault |

AI agents (Claude and Codex) also build and review much of the code. They follow the same rules, and their work arrives as pull requests too.

## Access

- **GitHub:** outside collaborator with admin access to the `croprxsolutions/CRX_Manager_V1.0` repository (Mason's decision, 2026-10-28).
- **Supabase:** Mason is adding Taha as an Administrator of the organization. Mason stays the Owner. That role covers every project in the organization.
- Turn on two-factor sign-in for both accounts. Admin access can reach the live database and its keys.
- Where every service, key and account lives: [[manual/SERVICES_AND_ACCOUNTS|Services and Accounts]]. It lists names and locations only, never values.

## Your job, and what's in scope

**The job:** stabilize, clean up and prove what already exists. No new features unless Mason asks.

**The deadline:** selling starts in the **second week of December 2026**. By then quoting, pre-booking, delivery, inventory, cost tracking and product pricing must be stable (Mason, 2026-10-16). Chem Man's last bill is 2026-12-31.

| In scope | Not in scope (for now) |
|---|---|
| Customers and the product catalog | Field application jobs and field invoicing, field maps, blend tickets |
| Monthly bulk price updates and price history | Compliance and EPA features |
| Cost tracking and margins | Crop programs, rebates, call lists, extra dashboards |
| Quotes, orders and deliveries | Redesigning accounts payable or commission payments |
| Chemical-sale invoicing | QuickBooks, Stripe, backups |
| Payments, prepay and receivables | |
| Inventory | |
| Core reports: sales, inventory, cost and margin, receivables | |

Field application is out of scope because it's already at Chem Man parity (see [[Chem-Man-vs-CRX|Chem Man vs CRX]]). Don't break it, though.

**Where to start:** the verified bug list Mason shares with you privately (it isn't in this public repo). The items in the December scope come first. Then the [[manual/TO_DO_LIST|To-Do List]].

## Ask Mason first

Admin access makes these possible. Don't do them without Mason's explicit OK in your conversation with him:
- changing the live database outside a reviewed migration, or applying a migration that deletes data;
- deleting any business data;
- deploying an Edge Function or making any production change outside the normal merge;
- changing secrets, logins, permissions, billing, domains or account ownership;
- force-pushing, or anything that rewrites shared history.

Everything else is your call. Mason would rather hear "here's what I did and how I proved it" than be asked about technical details.

## How work flows

1. **Pick work from the [[manual/TO_DO_LIST|To-Do List]].** It's in Mason's approved build order. Say which row you're taking, so you don't collide with an agent session working on the same thing.
2. **Branch from current `main`.** Nobody can push straight to `main`; GitHub blocks it.
3. **Open a pull request.** Write the description in plain English: what changes for the business, what could go wrong, and how you proved it works.
4. **Required checks must be green.** Changes that touch money, invoices, payments, inventory or cost get extra review. The full landing procedure is in `.claude/commands/ship.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
5. **Database changes go in a new migration file.** Never edit one that's already been applied. See [[workflows/DATABASE_CHANGE_CHECKLIST|Database Change Checklist]].
6. **Record what shipped.** Add a dated file in `changelog.d/`, and update [[manual/CURRENT_STATE|Current State]] or [[manual/KNOWN_ISSUES|Known Issues]] if they changed.

## Talking to Mason

- **Lead with the outcome,** in plain English: what's different now for the business.
- **Give one recommendation,** not a menu, unless it's truly his decision.
- **"Done" means you ran it and saw it work,** on the real screen or the real data path. Passing tests alone don't count.
- **Say what isn't verified yet** and what the risk is.
- **Decisions get written down.** When Mason decides something, add it to the [[manual/DECISION_LOG|Decision Log]] so nobody has to ask twice.

## Your first week

1. Get a local copy running: [[SETUP-NEW-MACHINE|Setup on a New Machine]].
2. Read [[manual/AGENT_ONBOARDING|Onboarding]] and [[manual/ARCHITECTURE|Architecture]], then the [[Codebase-Map|Codebase Map]].
3. Learn the business rules: [[workflows/QUOTE_TO_DELIVERY|Quote to Delivery]], [[workflows/INVENTORY_RULES|Inventory Rules]] and [[workflows/RLS_SECURITY_GUIDE|Who can see what]].
4. Read [[Plans-and-Roadmap|Plans and Roadmap]] and the [[manual/TO_DO_LIST|To-Do List]] to see what matters before January 1, 2027.
5. Skim the [[manual/DECISION_LOG|Decision Log]] so you don't reopen settled questions.
6. Read [[Lessons-Learned|Lessons Learned]]: the mistakes that already cost CRX time.
