# Agent Onboarding — How Not to Fail Here

**Last verified: 2026-10-09**
**Update triggers: when a new recurring failure class is identified or the guard system changes.**

You are a new coding agent starting your first session in CRX Manager. This file is the front door. It assumes you've already read the short shared contract in `AGENTS.md` and exists to make you behave like a senior engineer on this codebase instead of a junior one, on your very first turn.

CRX Manager is a **live production app** for a real agricultural chemical distributor. Real customers, real invoices, real money. Treat every mistake as one that could hit a real business tomorrow morning.

## Read order for your first session

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — the concise shared contract: owner communication, authority, routing, true non-negotiables, and completion standards.
2. **This file** — the failure modes that got past agents before you, and how to not repeat them.
3. **Follow the task table in `AGENTS.md`** — on the first coding session, skim `docs/reference/gotchas.md` once so you know what it covers. For each code change, read `docs/reference/coding-guidelines.md` and revisit only the relevant gotchas section. Add only the relevant sections of `docs/workflows/SAFE_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` when the task is multi-file or touches data, money, security, permissions, production, migrations, or customers; do not load the full rulebook for unrelated work.
4. **The `docs/workflows/` file routed for your task area** — e.g. `QUOTE_TO_DELIVERY.md` for the billing pipeline, `INVENTORY_RULES.md` for inventory, `DATABASE_CHANGE_CHECKLIST.md` before any migration, `RLS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` before touching policies.
5. **`docs/manual/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — orientation on how the app fits together. If it's missing, don't invent claims about structure — read the code directly instead.

Do not skip the routing decision because the task "looks simple." Start with the contract and this file, then load only the guidance the task actually needs.

## The 8 recurring bug classes

These are distilled from roughly 90 fix commits over about 20 days of this project's history (source: `.claude/workflows/money-inventory-hunt.js`, lines ~14–26). Every one of them has recurred more than once. Before you claim a change involving money, inventory, or a mutating RPC is clean, check it against every class below that applies.

**1. IDEMPOTENCY** — a mutating RPC that (a) reads/writes `idempotency_keys` with the wrong columns (correct: `idempotency_key` / `operation` / `result`; NEVER `key` / `entity_type` / `entity_id` / `result_id`), (b) does an UNSCOPED lookup not filtered by `operation='<this_rpc>'` (returns another op's cached row — the `restore_quote_version` bug class), (c) declares `p_idempotency_key` but the body never uses it, or (d) has no `p_idempotency_key` at all on a money/inventory write.
*Check before claiming clean:* grep the RPC body for `check_idempotency` / `save_idempotency` (or the canonical pattern in `gotchas.md`); confirm the operation string matches the function name; confirm the idempotency hook (`idempotency-body-check.mjs`) didn't block your write.

**2. FORGEABLE ACTOR** — a mutating financial/inventory RPC that trusts a `p_performed_by` / `p_actor` parameter instead of binding to `auth.uid()` and rejecting a mismatch. Canonical: `v_actor := auth.uid(); IF p_performed_by IS DISTINCT FROM v_actor THEN RAISE 'ACTOR_MISMATCH'`. A forged actor landing in `financial_audit_log` is a BLOCKER.
*Check before claiming clean:* grep the function body for every use of a caller-supplied actor param; confirm it's compared against a bound `auth.uid()`, never written to the audit log unchecked.

**3. MONEY-CENTS** — `parseFloat`/float math on a `*_cents` value; dollars-vs-cents mixups; penny-drift where each share/line is rounded independently so the parts don't sum to the whole (commission splits, payment allocation, split invoices, per-acre fees); any UPDATE that writes `invoices.balance_cents` (GENERATED ALWAYS — writing it is a bug). Legacy numeric-dollar storage such as `payments.amount` or `commissions.commission_amount` is not suppressed by type alone: verify exact numeric math, clean finite whole-cent values, and an active finite whole-cent CHECK; dirty or unconstrained columns remain findings.
*Check before claiming clean:* grep the diff for `parseFloat` near a `_cents` variable; if you split a total across N rows, confirm the parts sum exactly to the header total (largest-remainder or equivalent), not N independent roundings.

**4. CONCURRENCY** — a read-modify-write on inventory, holds, prebooked quantities, a balance, or a number-reservation with no `FOR UPDATE` row lock (or advisory lock), so two concurrent calls race (double-release, double-spend, duplicate number). `cancel_delivery`/`void_delivery`/quick-delivery release paths are the known hot spot.
*Check before claiming clean:* for any function that reads a balance/quantity then writes it back, confirm the SELECT uses `FOR UPDATE` (or an equivalent lock) before the write.

**5. STALE-DERIVED-STATE** — an edit path (`update_order_items`, recipe/job edit, field-invoice edit, same-product order edit) that recomputes one total but leaves a sibling derived value stale: `total_profit` / `net_margin_pct` / commissions / `total_cost_cents` / a report-feeding per-line column. These don't throw — they're silently wrong, and they feed reports like `get_sales_detail_report`.
*Check before claiming clean:* list every derived/sibling column that depends on the value you changed; confirm each is recomputed in the same transaction, not just the primary total.

**6. LIFECYCLE / SEGREGATION** — a status string written by frontend or RPC that is NOT in the live CHECK constraint for that table (the `void` vs `voided` class); a documented lifecycle transition no trigger/RPC actually enforces; an invoice-type leak (e.g. field-application rows showing in chemical-sales lists); a route/edit-lock bypassable by direct URL or once status is past the editable point.
*Check before claiming clean:* read the live CHECK constraint (`pg_constraint`, or `.claude/schema-registry.json`) for every status string you write — don't trust memory of what values "should" exist.

**7. UNCHECKED-ERRORS / TYPE-GUARDS** — a Supabase `.update()`/`.delete()` not followed by `checkMutationResult()`; an RPC result used without `assertRpcResult()`; a Supabase `{ error }` ignored; an untyped cast or `select('*')` that silently tolerates a renamed column; a page that throws blank on a null.
*Check before claiming clean:* grep your diff for every `.update(`, `.delete(`, and `.rpc(` call; confirm each has the matching check immediately after it.

**8. AUDIT-LOG-COMPLETENESS** — a mutating money RPC (invoice create/void, payment, write-off, credit memo, commission payout) that does not write the matching `financial_audit_log` row, so the append-only ledger is incomplete. Compare each money mutator against `create_invoice_from_order` as the reference pattern.
*Check before claiming clean:* for any new or changed money-mutating RPC, confirm it inserts into `financial_audit_log` with the right `entity_type`/`operation_type` (and that those values are in the CHECK constraint — see class 6).

## Process failure modes that got past smart agents

These are not code bugs — they're *how an agent convinced itself something was done when it wasn't.* Each has a concrete countermeasure baked into the guard system, not just a reminder.

- **Claiming done without running it.** The Stop hook (`stop-verify.mjs`) blocks "done" on a session that changed code unless the transcript shows a real `PROOF —` block or an actual preview/fetch/`execute_sql` run. It is a nudge, not a wall: it blocks at most twice per change-set and then fails open, so the discipline is yours. "Tests pass" is not accepted proof. Countermeasure: before you say a change is complete, write a line in the form `PROOF — Ran: … · Saw: … · Not verified: …` describing exactly what you executed and what you observed.

- **Trusting a handoff or summary over live state.** A prior session's summary, a stale doc, or another agent's claim of "this is already fixed/shipped" is often wrong or outdated. Countermeasure: verify the actual code and the live database yourself before acting on any handoff claim — read the function body, query the live table, don't take the word of a prior note.

- **Parallel-session blindness.** Mason frequently runs multiple sessions/worktrees at once. Claiming something "isn't shipped yet" or "needs a fix" without checking whether a sibling session already did it wastes work and can cause conflicting migrations. Countermeasure: check the worktree-awareness SessionStart output, run `/fleet` if unsure, and check git ancestry (`git fetch origin` + `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD`) before claiming something is or isn't live.

- **Stale schema registry.** `.claude/schema-registry.json` powers the schema-aware hooks, the session staleness check, and the schema-aware review subagents. If SessionStart warns it's behind a registry-relevant migration, working against it means your status/generated-column/RLS checks are checking against outdated facts. Countermeasure: regenerate it via the `regen-schema-registry` skill (live Supabase introspection → `--from-introspection` mode) before doing schema-aware work. Trap: running `node scripts/regenerate-schema-registry.mjs` with no arguments is "stamp" mode — it only bumps the date and refreshes nothing.

- **Doc-count drift.** Never hardcode counts of migrations, pages, or functions into always-loaded agent files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) — they go stale immediately and `npm run check:docs` will catch the drift. Countermeasure: put volatile counts only in `docs/reference/` files that the check validates, or don't hardcode them at all.

- **Re-emitting a function two pending migrations both touch.** If your migration does `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` on something another *not-yet-applied* migration also re-emits, whichever applies second silently clobbers the first's logic. Countermeasure: grep `supabase/migrations/` for other pending (unapplied) migrations touching the same function name before you write yours.

- **Editing an applied migration.** Forbidden, no exceptions. An applied migration is a permanent historical record; editing it means the file on disk no longer matches what actually ran against the live database, and re-running migrations elsewhere (a fresh environment, a review) produces a different schema than production has. Countermeasure: always create a new migration file, even for a one-line fix to something you wrote five minutes ago in the same session.

- **Replaying the full historical ledger into a fresh database.** The historical files are an immutable audit trail, not the current clean-build entry point. Some correctly fail-closed on production-specific data or byte-exact legacy function bodies. Countermeasure: initialize a new project from `supabase/baselines/manifest.json` in its declared order, then apply only migrations newer than that baseline. Run `npm run test:schema-baseline` before trusting the artifacts.

## The guard net will stop you — that's normal

This project has a real, enforced safety net: PreToolUse hooks that refuse a Write/Edit that matches a known bug pattern, a migration-apply-guard that requires a fresh review proof before `apply_migration` runs, a push-guard that requires a Codex verdict before a risky push, a pre-commit ledger guard that blocks agent-surface commits with no ledger update staged alongside, and Stop/PostToolUse hooks that force verification and flag loose ends. Full behavior is documented in `docs/reference/agent-guardrails.md` — read it, don't re-derive it here.

If a guard blocks you, the correct response is to **fix the underlying problem the guard is pointing at** — never to look for a way around it, disable it, edit the hook, or add an exemption comment you're not sure is warranted. If you genuinely believe a guard is wrong (a false positive on legitimate code), say so to Mason in plain English and let him decide — don't silently bypass it and don't unilaterally change guard config.

## Which review workflow do I use?

| Situation | Entry point | What it does NOT cover |
|---|---|---|
| Wrote or changed a **migration** | `/migration-review` | Produces the apply-guard proof for that migration; doesn't review unrelated frontend changes or push the migration live itself |
| Any **SQL / RLS / money / edge-fn** change, before push | `codex-review` | Two tiers, defined in `AGENTS.md` (model IDs in `docs/reference/codex-model-tuning.md`): **Luna** rounds iterate until clean; then every merge into `main` needs one fresh independent **Sol** high-effort review of the exact candidate SHA, run **last** (a later commit or moved base voids it), except a documentation-only change as defined in `docs/reference/sol-exempt-paths.md` (Mason, 2026-10-07). A clean Luna round is not the Sol proof, and a Luna round must never go through the proof wrapper. Neither replaces the migration-review proof for `apply_migration` |
| A **substantive feature** end to end | `/ship` pipeline | Includes the review fan-out. Under Mason's autonomous-landing rule (2026-09-26, `AGENTS.md`), once CodeRabbit has APPROVED the frozen final head, a fresh exact-SHA Sol review of that head is clean (not needed for a documentation-only change, `docs/reference/sol-exempt-paths.md`), and every required check is green, it applies the change's NON-destructive migration (its GRANT/REVOKE lines routine, none widening access) through the migration-apply-guard proof gate and then merges the exact reviewed head by itself, in any session, no ask. It always stops for Mason before a migration that deletes rows or drops data, overwrites existing rows, or widens access, an edge-function deploy, data deletion, and every other `AGENTS.md` hard gate |
| "**Is the whole app healthy?**" | `/audit` or `spot-check-prod` (live) | A point-in-time health read; doesn't fix anything it finds, and doesn't substitute for reviewing your specific change |
| Broad **foundation safety** sweep | `codex-gauntlet` (foundation mode) / `review-workflow` | Wide and read-only; not scoped to your one change, so still run a focused review on what you actually touched |
| **Two-model reconciliation** (Claude vs Codex disagree, or you want both) | `agent-pair-review` | Compares notes between models; doesn't apply fixes itself |

Direct reviews are read-only. PR comment posting defaults to dry-run. None of these workflows may push, deploy, apply a live migration, mutate/delete live data, or expose secrets without the authorization `AGENTS.md` requires. Under Mason's autonomous-landing rule (2026-09-26) an eligible NON-destructive migration (its grants routine, none widening access) applies in any session with no in-chat ask once the required review, check and migration-apply-guard gates pass. A destructive migration is refused for agents and Mason applies it himself; a migration that overwrites existing rows or widens access, an Edge Function deploy, data deletion, and changes to secrets, authentication, permissions (beyond a migration's routine grants), billing, domains or ownership always need his explicit go-ahead in this conversation.

## Verification standard

**Done means the changed behavior ran and was observed — not that a new test passed.** A test you wrote yourself can rubber-stamp the same misunderstanding that caused the bug in the first place.

- Small, low-risk, single-file change: a narrow check is enough (open the page and look, or run the one path).
- Money, data, auth, or multi-file/shared-logic change: run the full standard — `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, **plus** real-path proof (execute the RPC/flow and inspect the actual result, or open the page and watch it work).
- If you genuinely can't verify something (no live access, blocked tool, etc.), say exactly what you did NOT verify and what the remaining risk is. Do not round up to "done."

## Mason

Mason has ~0 coding background and cannot read a diff to catch your mistakes — he catches them from your plain-English description, not the code. Explain in plain English, defining any jargon the first time you use it. Lead with **one recommended next step**, not a menu of options — only ask him to choose when it's genuinely his call (a business or risk trade-off), not a technical detail you're equipped to decide yourself. Decisions about money, live production changes, and anything irreversible are his to make, not yours to assume.
