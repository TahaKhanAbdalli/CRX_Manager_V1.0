# Rolled-Back E2E Smoke Chains (C2 control, minimal slice)

## The hard rule

> **A fix is "fixed" only when its full business-chain spec passes — never an
> isolated probe.**

This directory exists because of 2026-06-09's B1: `issue_return_credit` was
declared "fixed" off a single invoice-insert probe, while the *chain*
(return → credit → statement → unapply) was still broken three more ways
(missing `returns.credited_by` column, a CHECK rejection, a 42804 cast).
8 of the 52 historical Codex findings were latent breaks in never-exercised
RPC paths that only a full chain execution surfaces
(`docs/audits/2026-06-10-error-prevention-review.md` §2 RC3, §4 C2).

Corollaries:

- **Every migration-touched RPC must have (or extend) a spec** in
  `smoke-specs.json` whose `covers` includes it, and that chain must PASS
  after apply, before the work is called done.
- An isolated statement probe ("the insert works now") is **never** evidence
  of a fix. It may be a *step* inside a chain; it is not a spec.
- New authenticated SECURITY DEFINER mutators also get the standard 4-probe
  auth set — copy `smoke-auth-probe-template.sql`.

## What lives here

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `smoke-specs.json` | Registry: primary RPC → `{ chain, description, covers }`. `covers` lists every RPC the chain exercises, so one chain certifies several RPCs. |
| `run-smoke.mjs` | Zero-dep runner. `--list`, `--spec <rpc>`, `--area <area>` (business-area tags; see `scripts/test-areas.json` and `scripts/run-area.mjs`), `--all`. |
| `smoke-*.sql` | The chains. Each is ONE `DO` block that always ends in `RAISE EXCEPTION 'SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK'` — nothing ever commits. |

## Running

```bash
node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --list           # what specs exist
node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --spec receive_return   # matches keys OR covers
node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --all
```

Two modes:

1. **Claude-first (default).** Without `SUPABASE_DB_URL`, the runner prints
   each selected chain with banners and instructions. Claude executes the SQL
   as **one statement** via Supabase MCP `execute_sql` (project
   `rhyzpcqhnizqbxphqdkr`) and interprets the result.
2. **psql.** With `SUPABASE_DB_URL` set, the runner executes each chain via
   `psql -1 -f` and reports PASS/FAIL itself.

**Result contract (both modes):** the chain ALWAYS errors.

- Error text contains `SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK` → **PASS** (and proves the
  rollback fired — nothing persisted).
- Any other error, or no error at all → **FAIL**; report the message verbatim.

The full-gauntlet chain also proves the versioned `save_blend_ticket` contract:
normal save, exact idempotent replay, required-version rejection, OCR-processing
rejection, and stale-edit rejection both before and after an OCR commit.

## Disposable concurrency companion

Single-transaction smoke chains cannot create real lock contention. The
gauntlet migrations therefore have a separate two-session proof:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/prove-gauntlet-idempotency-concurrency.mjs
```

It loads the checked-in `check_idempotency`, inline-insert trigger, and linked
blend-ticket header/product lock definitions verbatim into a uniquely named
`crx-gauntlet-idem-proof-*` PostgreSQL container. The container has no network,
stores PostgreSQL data in tmpfs, never reads a DB URL, and is force-removed in
`finally` after success or failure. The proof races both the canonical helper
path and a legacy business-work-before-inline-ledger path, requiring one effect,
one ledger row, exact replay for the helper caller, and
`IDEMPOTENCY_CONCURRENT_REPLAY_RETRY` plus full effect rollback for the legacy
loser. It also races link-first and product-first transactions to prove the
parent-row lock serializes edits and rejects a product edit that loses to a link.
The same disposable database loads the checked-in atomic OCR commit function
and proves three real two-session losers roll back cleanly: approval-first,
link-first, and lease-change-first.

## Disposable Supplier Pricing Phase 1a proof

The live additive bootstrap, live pre-deploy zero-cost guard, and parked
enforcement cutover have a separate, production-isolated proof:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/prove-supplier-pricing-phase1a.mjs
```

The runner creates a uniquely named PostgreSQL 17 container with networking
disabled and data in tmpfs, loads a live-shaped minimal base, compiles the exact
live additive bootstrap, proves the currently deployed editor can still write
one legacy Product/history pair without double logging, compiles and exercises
the exact compatibility-safe zero-cost guard, then compiles the exact parked
cutover. It generates and edits a real `.xlsx`, parses it through the
application workbook module, and passes that payload through real PostgreSQL
preview/apply RPCs with exact Product/history verification and rollback. The
final-state proof also exercises authorization, both pricing modes, formula/tamper/
version/collision-safe identity conflicts, atomic rollback, durable idempotent
replay and cross-change-set key rejection, direct-write denial, and exactly-once
history. It also proves an ordinary rate edit can recalculate server-derived
per-acre prices while a caller still cannot write those derived values directly.
The runner force-removes the exact container in `finally`; it never
reads a Supabase URL and does not apply or alter production.

## Disposable draw-down and priced-product smoke proof

The pending draw-down price-tier migration and the quote smoke fixtures that
depend on governed product pricing share one current-schema replay:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/prove-draw-down-price-tier-real-schema.mjs
```

The runner restores the supported baseline and replays all 56 migrations in the
verified live source history. SQL is normalized to LF before replay so Windows
line endings cannot create false preflight drift; the parked candidate itself
must remain LF byte-verbatim. Any replay failure or non-empty skip set fails
closed. Before applying the parked draw-down migration, it requires
five pricing-sensitive chains to reach `SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK`: the auth probe,
planned-holds synchronization, draw-ledger reversal, order draw lock, and job
from quote activity-feed chain. It then mutation-tests the candidate-specific
restore guard, applies the candidate only inside the disposable container, and
requires the repaired restore chain to pass. The schema-only database is seeded
with two governed-looking priced products while the pricing trigger is disabled
for that seed alone; the trigger is restored before any chain executes. The
container has no network, never reads a Supabase URL, and is force-removed in
`finally`.

Safety notes:

- Chains run as table owner; direct fixture INSERTs bypass RLS but the RPCs
  under test still enforce their own gates (auth is simulated via
  transaction-local `request.jwt.claims` with a REAL active profile id).
- Benign side effects that survive rollback: sequence consumption (e.g.
  `cm_invoice_number_seq` in the return chain — `next_invoice_number`
  self-heals), and brief row locks. `smoke-auto-expire-draw-skip.sql` also
  transiently locks/expires real expired quotes inside its rolled-back
  transaction — run off-hours if cautious (see its header).

## Disposable Phase 3 return-policy chain proof

`smoke-supplier-pricing-phase3-return-policy.sql` prices its products through the
governed preview/apply RPCs and delivers each returned line through the real
`complete_delivery` before returning it. This replays the current schema in a
network-disabled container and proves the chain passes, plus two controls
(without the pricing setup it stops at `COST_BASIS_REQUIRED`, without the
deliveries at `RETURN_SOURCE_NOT_DELIVERED`):

```bash
node scripts/smoke/prove-supplier-pricing-phase3-return-policy-real-schema.mjs
```

## Adding a chain when shipping a migration

For every RPC the migration creates or modifies:

1. **Check coverage:** `node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --spec <rpc>`.
   If a spec covers it, *extend that chain* with assertions for the new
   behavior. If not, write a new `smoke-<short-name>.sql`.
2. **Investigate live first, then write.** Read the LIVE function body
   (`pg_get_functiondef`), the fixture tables' columns
   (`information_schema.columns`), CHECK constraints (`pg_constraint`), and
   triggers (`pg_trigger`) via read-only MCP `execute_sql`. **Dry-validate
   every table/column/function reference against the live catalog before
   declaring the smoke ready** — this is the discipline that prevents the
   42703 (column-does-not-exist) class. Never write fixture SQL from memory
   or from disk migration files.
3. **Follow the house conventions** (see any existing `smoke-*.sql`):
   - single `DO` block = single transaction; terminal
     `RAISE EXCEPTION 'SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK'`;
   - synthetic `[SMOKE]`-prefixed fixtures with a random suffix; reference
     real rows only as FK targets (e.g. an active admin profile);
   - auth via `set_config('request.jwt.claims', json_build_object('sub',
     v_real_profile_id, 'role', 'authenticated')::text, true)` — set claims
     at the top level, not inside probe sub-blocks (local GUCs roll back with
     sub-transactions);
   - expected-failure steps wrapped in `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION` sub-blocks,
     matching error tokens with `SQLERRM LIKE 'TOKEN%'`;
   - every failure message prefixed `SMOKE_FAIL:` (setup gaps:
     `SMOKE_SETUP:`) with the actual values interpolated;
   - cover the FULL business chain, including the reversal/unapply leg and an
     idempotency replay where the RPC takes a key;
   - if a step is impossible synthetically (e.g. requires storage objects),
     say so honestly in the header and cover the longest possible prefix.
4. **Register it** in `smoke-specs.json`: key = primary RPC, `covers` = every
   RPC exercised, description = what the chain proves.
5. **Run it** (post-apply, rolled back) and require `SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK`
   before claiming the fix/feature works.

For the `save_field` actor-binding migration, the exact migration and rollback
chain can be proven without contacting Supabase:

```bash
node scripts/smoke/prove-save-field-actor-binding.mjs
```

For new mutators, also adapt `smoke-auth-probe-template.sql` (placeholders
documented in its header): no-auth → `AUTH_REQUIRED`, anon-key →
`AUTH_REQUIRED` + zero rows written, wrong-role → `INSUFFICIENT_ROLE`, forged
actor param → `ACTOR_MISMATCH`, plus a positive control proving the probes
failed for the right reason.

## How /ship should invoke this (wiring — reported, not yet wired)

This slice deliberately does not edit `package.json`, hooks, or
`.claude/commands/ship.md`. Suggested wiring:

- **npm script** (`package.json` → `scripts`):
  `"smoke": "node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs"`
  (usage: `npm run smoke -- --spec <rpc>`).
- **/ship step (after `apply_migration` + B7 rename, before commit):** for
  every RPC named in the migration, run
  `node scripts/smoke/run-smoke.mjs --spec <rpc>`.
  - Runner exits 2 with "no spec covers" → write/extend a chain first
    (step list above) — this is a gate, not a suggestion.
  - Claude executes the printed chain(s) via MCP `execute_sql` and applies
    the PASS contract; any non-`SMOKE_PASS_ROLLBACK` error blocks the ship
    until fixed (then re-run the FULL chain — not just the failing step).
- **Codex handoff packets:** include the chain results (spec key + PASS) so
  round 1 starts from executed evidence instead of isolated-probe claims.
- Optional later hardening: a Stop/PreToolUse hook that refuses "fixed"
  claims for migration-touched RPCs without a fresh chain PASS marker —
  out of scope for this slice.
