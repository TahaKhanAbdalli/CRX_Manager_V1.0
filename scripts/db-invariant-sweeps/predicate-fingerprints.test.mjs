// 14. No predicate has a line break INSIDE a string literal, quoted identifier

//     Both allowances fold CRLF and lone CR to LF before fingerprinting. That is

//     ends a `--` comment (PostgreSQL ends a comment at CR as well as LF). A
//     line break inside a literal is part of the value, so folding it would let
//     a CR-variant of the text share the fingerprint while reading a different
//     value. The guard comment states the 29 have none; this enforces it, so a
//     predicate that adds one fails here instead of silently widening what the
//     fingerprint covers (Luna review of this change). The walker mirrors the
//     guard's own quote-aware scanner; it only has to be right for these files.
