-- predicate: quote-versions-rpc-owned
-- CRX-SEC-1 (found 2026-08-13 by the exact-SHA adversarial review of PR #389).
-- public.quote_versions.snapshot_data is an AUTHORITATIVE cost source: since
-- 20260812115236, restoring a version stamps quote_items.cost_at_quote_cents
-- from snapshot_data.sections[].items[].current_cost, convert_quote_to_order copies that
-- into order_items.cost_per_unit / cost_at_time_cents, and canonical profit and
-- commissions derive from there. So any client-writable path into this table is
-- a path into commission money, and the below-cost approval trigger does not
-- catch it — that trigger compares SALE PRICE to LIVE cost and understating the
-- historical cost basis only raises apparent margin.
--
-- The write boundary this predicate defends, installed by 20260813080000:
--   * no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/FOR ALL policy on quote_versions;
--   * no direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE/TRIGGER/REFERENCES privilege for
--     anon/authenticated — six, which is the full write-capable set minus
--     MAINTAIN, deliberately kept and explained at the migration's REVOKE.
--     (TRUNCATE matters independently — RLS policies do not apply to it at all);
--   * SELECT and qversions_select preserved, because version history must keep
--     rendering and this predicate must not pass by having broken reads;
--   * the owner-side writer _create_quote_version_owner_impl stays a
--     search_path-pinned SECURITY DEFINER owned by an RLS-bypassing role and
--     stays uncallable by anon/authenticated — it is the ONLY routine in the
--     database that INSERTs quote_versions, so it is the sole author of the
--     snapshot_data that the restore path later trusts as a cost basis.
--     (It does NOT hold crx.quote_cost_snapshot_passthrough — an earlier draft
--     said so and was wrong. That flag is armed by save_quote and by
--     _restore_quote_version_owner_impl, both in 20260812115236. Chasing the
--     passthrough from here would lead a reader to the wrong function.);
--   * the two public entry points stay authenticated-only.
--
-- SCOPE: this is a BROWSER-role boundary. service_role keeps full write access,
-- as it does on every table; "RPC-owned" means no anon/authenticated path.
--
-- Historical catch: CRX-SEC-1, 2026-08-13. No evidence of exploitation: every
-- existing snapshot cost line parsed as a number, resolved to a real product,
-- and carried a stored basis EXACTLY equal to that product's catalog cost
-- (3 version rows, 5 lines, re-measured read-only 2026-08-14). The first
-- revision of that check used a below-half band and was rejected by review
-- finding CRX-QV-001 — a basis forged at 60% of cost clears a 50% band, and a
-- percentage cannot prove provenance. Even exact, this is a check against
-- TODAY's cost, not proof no forged row was ever written and later reverted.
-- Contract: EXPECT ZERO rows. Any row means the forged-version path is open
-- again, or that it was "closed" by breaking the legitimate one.
