// Apply a migration to live from its FILE BYTES, through the same gate the MCP
// `apply_migration` tool goes through.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-24)
//   `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` takes `{project_id, name, query}` — a pasted
//   string, no file path. The apply gate binds the reviewer proof to
//   sha256(transmitted query), and scripts/write-apply-proofs.mjs pins that hash
//   to the on-disk file (CRLF→LF normalized). Those two facts are good: together
//   they guarantee the SQL that runs is the SQL that was reviewed.
//
//   But they made a large migration unappliable. 20260816120000_draw_down_split_
//   order_lines_by_price_tier.sql is 162,022 bytes / 2,891 lines; no single tool
//   call can re-emit that byte-exact, so the hash never matched and the change
//   could not reach live at all — blocked by its own size, not by any finding.
//
//   This script is a SECOND DOOR WITH THE SAME LOCK. It reads the file, asks
//   .claude/hooks/migration-apply-lib.mjs (the identical rule book the PreToolUse
//   hook consults) for a verdict, and transmits only on "allow". Because the file
//   is both what gets hashed and what gets sent, the content binding finally works
//   in our favour instead of against us.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT
//   It is NOT the raw management-API channel documented for read-only
//   BEGIN..ROLLBACK proof bundles. That channel POSTs SQL with no gate at all.
//   Every transmission here is downstream of evaluateMigrationApply(), and there
//   is deliberately no code path to fetch() that skips it.
//
// USAGE
//   Dry run (evaluates the gate, transmits nothing) — always do this first:
//     node scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs supabase/migrations/<file>.sql
//
//   Real apply (requires an explicit flag AND a token in the environment):
//     SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... node scripts/apply-migration-file.mjs <file>.sql --confirm
//
//   Flags:
//     --confirm            actually transmit. Without it this is a dry run.
//     (no --name flag: the ledger name is derived from the filename — see LEDGER NAME)
//     --created-by <who>   ledger created_by (default: the CRX ledger convention)
//
//   There is deliberately NO --project flag; the target is pinned to CRX
//   production. See TARGET below.
//
// AUTHORIZATION
//   Mason's autonomous-landing rule (2026-09-26): a NON-destructive migration whose
//   final exact-SHA Sol review and CodeRabbit review are clean applies with no
//   per-migration ask, in any session, once the rule book passes — both reviewer
//   proofs and a fresh content-bound gpt-6-sol/high proof, all under 30 minutes.
//   A migration that DELETES data, OVERWRITES existing rows or CHANGES WHO CAN
//   ACCESS WHAT stays Mason's. There is deliberately no override flag — a flag the
//   agent can pass itself cannot prove Mason approved that exact migration (Sol
//   HIGH, 2026-09-26). What counts is his own `approve <code>` chat reply to a request
//   for this exact file, pull request and head (scripts/owner-approve-migration.mjs;
//   Mason, 2026-09-29; by reply instead of Windows Hello since 2026-10-09).
//   This script is the only door that accepts it: the rule book checks it LAST,
//   after every other proof, and this script marks it used before transmitting,
//   so each approval installs one migration once.

  // refused for "not being the approved artifact". It could never authorize unsafe
  // SQL, but it would block real work in the layout this repo actually uses, where
  // dozens of worktrees run at once.
  //
  // The rule was always meant to be "the argument must BE one of the permitted
  // files", and every permitted location is equally approved: `ok: true` already
  // guarantees the content matched a permitted file, and each candidate lives in a
  // session-scoped checkout the proof lookup already trusts.

  // symlink to an external file in a second checkout would then resolve to the same
