This is the B7 pattern from 2026-05-26.
1. Extract the timestamp prefix from each filename: \`<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<description>.sql\`.
2. You CANNOT call Supabase MCP (your tools are Read/Grep/Glob/Bash). Do NOT attempt the Supabase MCP \`list_migrations\` tool. Compare the on-disk filename timestamps against each other for ordering sanity, then look for a current orchestrator-recorded \`list_migrations\` preflight in \`docs/reference/migration-history.md\` or the task evidence. Before apply, the disk timestamp must be **strictly greater than the current live effective ordering high-water**. Supabase MCP assigns a fresh live version at apply time, so the pre-apply filename is NOT expected to equal that future value.
3. Build the effective ordering stamp **row by row**, matching the deterministic apply guard: use the 14-digit timestamp embedded in that ledger row's \`name\` when present; only when the row's \`name\` has no 14-digit timestamp, use its 14-digit \`version\` as the conservative fallback. The fallback prevents a timestamp-less legacy name from disappearing from the comparison. Do NOT compare against a bare \`max(version)\` or \`.claude/schema-registry.json\`'s \`_meta.migrations_high_water\`: those version-only figures discard the ledger names, so they cannot tell which rows legitimately need the fallback and can emit a false **HIGH** when the newest applied row has an authored name stamp. \`.claude/hooks/migration-ordering-lib.mjs\` and \`scripts/refresh-applied-migrations.mjs\` are the executable sources for this row-by-row rule; \`docs/reference/migration-history.md\` explains the same calculation in plain English.
4. If no current live effective ordering high-water evidence derived from both \`name\` and fallback \`version\` is available, emit a **HIGH** finding telling the orchestrator to run Supabase MCP \`list_migrations\` and calculate it row by row. If evidence shows the filename is not greater, emit **HIGH** and require a fresh filename. If current evidence proves it is greater, this check is clean.
5. Always note the post-apply B7 reconciliation requirement: after a successful MCP apply, read the new ledger row's \`version\` and \`name\`, normalize the live name and disk basename with the repository's migration-ordering convention, and update migration history before commit. If the normalized live \`name\` already matches the authored disk basename, keep the disk filename; a differing apply-time \`version\` alone does **not** require a rename. Rename to the MCP-assigned version only when the live \`name\` does not preserve the authored basename, so disk and ledger would otherwise remain unmatched. This is a post-apply obligation, not a pre-apply finding.

// enumeration is forbidden because two real runs died after 598 and 751
// fetch_blob calls with no verdict at all.
//
// REVISED 2026-09-04 after CodeRabbit on PR #594. The method was first written
// as a SINGLE name-level pass ("ideally ONE grep -rnoiE"), which cannot answer
// the rule it is attached to: -o prints only the matched name, discarding the
// argument list and any preceding DROP FUNCTION, and steps 2-3 consume exactly
// those. It also said "do NOT read migration files one at a time", which
// outlawed the follow-up read that recovers them. The method is now two-phase —
// A discovers candidates, B reads their full declarations — so pin BOTH phases
// AND the sentence that denies phase A the verdict. Pinning phase A alone would
// be satisfied by the very defect this revision fixes.
//
// DEFERRED (Mason, 2026-09-04): the overload-EVIDENCE question — what live
// catalog proof may acquit a history-detected collision, and how the sandboxed
// proof runner could ever supply it — is a separate task with its own plan.
// See docs/manual/KNOWN_ISSUES.md.
