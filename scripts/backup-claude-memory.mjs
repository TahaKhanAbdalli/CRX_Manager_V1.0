// Claude agent-memory off-site snapshot — the deterministic half of the
// /backup-claude-memory flow.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the agent memory notes live ONLY on Mason's machine, under
// ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project>/memory/. Nothing backs them up. They are
// also the one thing that CANNOT go in this repo: CRX_Manager_V1.0 is PUBLIC and
// the notes carry real commission payouts naming real people. So the memory dir
// is gitignored here (see .gitignore) and the durable copy goes to the PRIVATE
// repo masonwells1/CRX_Backups — the same place the weekly encrypted DB dump goes.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE: mirrors scripts/backup-db.mjs. That script does everything that
// does NOT need credentials, and the driving Claude session does the part that
// does (there, the MCP dumps; here, the git push to the private repo). This
// script therefore never touches the network and never sees a token — it stages
// and verifies a snapshot on disk, and the session commits it.
//
//   --stage <dir>        copy every *.md from the source memory dir into <dir>,
//                        write <dir>/manifest.json (per-file sha256 + bytes), and
//                        verify the copy byte-for-byte against the source
//   --source <dir>       source memory dir; auto-discovered when omitted
//   --verify <dir>       re-check an existing staged dir against its own manifest
//                        (use before committing, and after a restore)
//   --verify-remote <dir> after pushing, download every remote note and prove
//                        its bytes match the local manifest
//
// Safety properties:
//   - read-only against the source: it is only ever opened for reading
//   - never deletes anything outside <dir>, and never recursively force-deletes
//     (`rm -rf` is hard-blocked in this repo); stale *.md in <dir> are removed
//     file-by-file so a shrinking memory set cannot leave orphans behind
//   - every staged file is re-read and hashed AFTER writing — a truncated or
//     partial copy FAILS the run rather than silently shipping a broken backup
//   - refuses to stage an empty source (a wrong --source path must not quietly
//     produce a valid-looking empty backup that overwrites a good one)
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/backup-claude-memory.mjs --stage <dir> [--source <dir>]
//   node scripts/backup-claude-memory.mjs --verify <dir>
// Exit:   0 = OK, 1 = verification failure, 2 = usage error.
// Deps:   none (node builtins only).

// new, empty, or a previous snapshot written by THIS script — and pruning is
// limited to files that snapshot's own manifest recorded. Anything else fails
// BEFORE a single byte is written or deleted.
// Its first check is destinationIsPublishable(), defined below.
//
// The notes carry real names and commission amounts, and `CRX_Manager_V1.0` is
// PUBLIC. `.gitignore` covers the one documented directory (`docs/claude-memory/`),
// but the runbook says "<staging-dir>" without pinning it, so an agent that picked
// any other path inside this checkout would create tracked, publishable files —
// and a public commit is not undoable by a later delete. Codex's eighth 2026-07-30
// review found this. The off-site repo is deliberately unaffected: there the notes
// ARE tracked on purpose, which is the whole point of the backup — so the refusal
// is scoped to the app repo, not to "any git worktree".
//
// Round ten inverted the rule. Naming the one repo to refuse meant every OTHER
// repository was accepted by default — a wrong clone, a public fork, a replaced
// remote, a checkout with no remote at all — and the runbook goes on to commit and
// push whatever was staged. Codex's tenth 2026-07-30 review called that out, and
// it is right: for content that can never be un-published, the safe default is
// "no". So a tracked destination must now name the ONE private off-site repo, and
// everything else is refused. The two legitimate non-repo cases still work: a
// path git ignores (nothing there can be committed) and a directory outside any
// repository at all.
// Repository identity comes from the ONE canonicalizer in the hooks library
// (CLAUDE.md: `.claude/hooks/` is the single source of truth for shared guard
// logic). A second, weaker copy here is exactly how this check would drift out of
// agreement with the push guard — and it already had the same defect the guard
// did: `https://github.com/masonwells1/./CRX_Manager_V1.0.git` is the public repo,
