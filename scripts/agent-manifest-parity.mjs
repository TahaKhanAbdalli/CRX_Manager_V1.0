// Pure logic for the hook-manifest parity check (2026-07-16 scaffolding review,
// sync-adapter finding). Both the Claude side (.claude/settings.json) and the
// Codex side (.codex/hooks.json) wire the SAME shared implementations under
// .claude/hooks/. Nothing enforced that the two wirings stay in step, so a NEW
// Claude-side guard could be added to settings.json and silently never fire for
// Codex — the designated builder. This diffs the two hook-script sets and FAILS
// on any asymmetry that isn't an explicitly-declared, deliberate one-sided hook.
//
// Adding a new guard therefore forces a conscious choice: wire it on BOTH sides,
// or add it to CLAUDE_ONLY_HOOKS / CODEX_ONLY_HOOKS below with the reason. The
// check can't be satisfied by accident.

// Deliberately Claude-only hooks (NOT wired for Codex), each with why:
export const CLAUDE_ONLY_HOOKS = new Set([

  // guards.

  "pr-merge-guard.mjs",

  // crashes or runs out of time (Sol, 2026-09-27). It launches only that
  // Claude-only guard. The Codex production guard denies on a runtime crash itself;
  // a watchdog for a kill at its timeout is a recorded follow-up

  // event; its contract comes from AGENTS.md." The first clause is false —
  // .codex/hooks.json registers a SessionStart group (session-snapshot.mjs,
  // session-staleness.mjs, worktree-awareness.mjs), so the event is wired on that
  // side; what the Codex harness does with that registration, including whether it
  // consumes additionalContext, is not verified here. The second clause stands as
  // recorded (AGENTS.md is the shared contract for every agent), but nothing
  // establishes it as the operative reason for leaving this hook Claude-only.
